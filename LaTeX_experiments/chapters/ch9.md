### Chapter 9

## Afternoon of a Mathematician

Bevis Spencer tapped on my shoulder while I was waiting with my basket wagon at one of the checking counters. “Hi, Alec.”

I nodded briskly

His somber face clouded. He leaned close to my ear. “I had to testify at your trial. I was subpoenaed. I tried to make whatever I had to say sound as good for you as I could.”

“You didn’t hurt me.”

“I tried not to,” he said.

A clerk at the vegetable section called him and he bustled off. Bevis was a different man in his father’s store. His awkwardness was left outside; he moved about with efficiency and assurance, supervising and trouble-shooting.

The unfamiliar business of ration stamps floored me at the checking counter, but the girl checker was pleasant and patient. I doubted if I’d ever seen her before, but she called me Mr. Linn and the girl at the next counter was giving me sidelong glances, Word must have passed around that I was in the store. I was the most notorious resident of West Amber.

While I was putting the bundles on the back seat of the sedan, I heard my name called. Bevis Spencer’s long body in its flapping white coat moved rapidly along the sunbaked sidewalk. I closed the car door and faced him.

“Alec,” he blurted, “you have no objection to me, have you?”

“As what?”

“As Miriam’s husband.”

“Her opinion is the one that counts.”

“I know, but—” Bevis regarded the tip of his cigarette. “Dad says he’ll make me an equal partner in the store when I marry. It’s a good store, the best in the country, and I’ll have a big income.”

“She’s the one to tell it to.”

“I’ve told her everything I can to convince her. I’ve never loved another woman and I never will. And she likes me. I’m sure she does.”

“If she didn’t, she would have turned you down the first time you asked her.”

“That is it,” he said eagerly. “She cares enough for me to be undecided. Maybe she doesn’t quite love me yet, but she will. I’ll make her love me.” His deep-set, intense eyes bored into me. “Alec, if you’ll tell her to marry me—”

“I’m not her master.”

“Of course I don’t mean tell her. Advise her. She thinks the world of your opinion. If you’d just sort of mention that you don’t object to me as her husband—”

“She’s got to make up her own mind.”

“I guess that’s so. But you don’t object to me, do you?”

“I don’t if Miriam doesn’t.” I laughed mirthlessly. “Speaking about objections, your father just got through telling me to stay away from Helen. He’s afraid I’ll marry her and then shove a knife into her.”

“So that’s why you were huffy in the store? I’m not responsible for Dad.”

“You think the same way. Everybody does.”

Bevis searched my face anxiously. “You’re not still in love with Helen?”

“You needn’t worry.”

“You have me all wrong. I’d back you to the limit with Helen. Dad’s crazy.”

“That was only kid stuff. Besides, she’s Kerry’s girl now.”

“Kerry is okay.” Bevis flipped away his cigarette. “Well back to work. See you at the poker game tonight.”

***

I headed toward home. When I came to the Old Mill Road intersection, I changed my mind and swung right. While I was at it, I might as well make a clean sweep of the Spencer family, and the hell with Oliver Spencer.

I hadn’t visited the Spencer home since my third year at college when Helen and I had started to drift away from each other. The house was a sprawling single story of many wings which had grown, with the prosperity of the food market, from a three-room box. Helen Spencer was on the side field-stone terrace. She reclined with a book on a chaise longue. She wore navy blue shorts and a flowered halter. No shoes or stockings.

“Did you hear the news?” she said excitedly. “Kerry wrote to his commanding officer for another thirty-day leave, and he got it.”

“That’s swell.” I sat down beside her fine bare legs. Her toenails were scarlet. “Did Lily teach you to paint them?”

“I got the idea from her.” She wiggled her toes. “Don’t you like it?”

“Not any more. What did you leave out from your testimony at the trial?”

“Nothing. Perhaps a few details.”

“What were they?”

Helen asked me for a cigarette and lay back puffing on it. She had an enticing body, as smoothly rounded as a baby’s without being tubby.

“Dad has a store and everybody knows him, so I didn’t want to say anything that would cause gossip,” she said presently. “This last year I went out several times with Lily on double dates. I don’t mean that Lily got men for me, except once, but sometimes Lily asked me to bring my date along, whoever it happened to be that night, and make a foursome.”

“Whom was she with?”

“Generally Bill Beaty until he was drafted, and twice this spring Emil Schneider after his wife left him.” She stirred her hips uneasily. “You must think I’m awful, Alec, going out on dates like that with your wife, but they seemed harmless. I didn’t know till the trial that she was actually having affairs with those men. And she was very sweet to me. I didn’t know a thing about clothes or makeup and what to wear with what till she taught me.”

I twisted around for another look at her toenails. “Lily was a glamour girl from New York,” I said. “She took you under her wing. She liked you or was bored and wanted somebody to work on. She dressed you and painted you.”

“Why shouldn’t I look smooth?” Helen said defensively.

“Smooth as lacquer.”

“You liked it in Lily.”

“Did I?” The question was to myself and the answer too complicated to think about.

Helen said: “I admired her and wanted to be like her. I mean so beautifully turned out and sophisticated. I don’t mean the other thing—with men. After what happened at the roadhouse on the Fourth of July I became disgusted with her.”

“What about that?”

***

“It was the way I told it at the trial. I didn’t keep any of that back; I wanted to help you. That was the first and only date I let Lily get for me. Her ex-husband, Don, drove up from New York with a man named Walter, and Lily asked me as a favor to come along for Walter. I didn’t like him at all. He had a long face that was as blank as a wall and small eyes that had no expression except when he looked at me and then they seemed to be undressing me. But I must say this for him—he never tried to make a pass at me. Well, you heard at the trial how Lily got very drunk and let Don paw her right in public and what she said about you. Then Bevis and Miriam came in for beer and dancing and they saw what was going on at our table and they took me home. I was glad to go, I can tell you. You can imagine the battle in our two houses that night. Bevis told Dad and he—”

“Two houses?” I said.

“Your house was the other one, of course. I learned from Bevis next day that Lily hadn’t come home till dawn and that Miriam had waited up for her and then Miriam had given it to her with both barrels. The argument woke Ursula. She came down and tried to make peace between them, but Miriam said she wouldn’t stay in the house with Lily and that one of them had to leave.”

“I had the impression that it was Ursula who had the fight with Lily.”

“No—Miriam. In fact, Ursula didn’t want to do anything about Lily till you returned. They were expecting you home in a week or two. But Miriam refused to listen. She started to pack up to leave, so what could Ursula do? Lily was kicked out, and that afternoon she rented the bungalow on James Street.”

There was a silence.

“Go on,” I urged.

“You heard at the trial how she phoned me that evening to try to explain away what she had said about you while drunk. I found Emil Schneider with her. That’s about all.”

“No, it isn’t,” I said. “You held back something important at the trial.”

Helen turned her eyes to the sun and closed them against the glare. Pearls of sweat were on her upper lip. “Don Yard hit Dad. You won’t tell anybody?”

“No.”

“It was my fault and Dad’s, too. I didn’t want to have anything more to do with Lily. Then one Saturday evening—it was a week before you came home—she phoned me. She said she had a party and needed more women and would I come. I was about to say no, but Dad was listening in on the extension in his room. He broke in and told me not to dare go, so—” She paused.

“So you went.”

Her round chin jutted. “I’m not a child. He and Bevis tried to make me use less makeup and objected to some of my clothes. Then this. Dad had no business ordering me around like that. Then he came out to the hall and ordered me again not to go. If he’d only told me in a different way—” Her bare shoulders shrugged. “I went without changing my clothes. There was quite a party when I reached the bungalow. Don and Walter and two other men had driven up from the city with a woman. Her name was Bertha—I never learned any of their second names. She was a stunning redhead who dressed beautifully, though she couldn’t hold a candle to Lily. She and Lily kept making catty remarks about each other. I think it was because of Don.”

“Why should Lily have cared?” I said. “She hadn’t wanted to go back to him.”

“You know how women are. Especially women like Lily who can get any man they want. She didn’t want Don, but she didn’t want anybody else to have him either. I think Bertha hated her because she was afraid Lily might decide to take him back some time Perhaps I’m wrong; it was only a notion I had. Actually I wasn’t there more than twenty minutes. Then Dad came in.”

***

Helen seemed suddenly cold in the hot sun. “It was awful. Nobody but Lily knew who he was, but there was something about the way he stood there looking at them and at all the liquor and then at me that made them very quiet. It would have been all right even then if Lily hadn’t opened her big mouth. She said: ‘Why don’t you let the kid have some fun, Pop?”

Dad went over to Lily and slapped her face. And Don hit Dad on the jaw.”

I rose to my feet and stood there rattling change in my pocket.

“Dad was knocked off his feet,” Helen went on. She was breathing hard, her full breasts rising and falling under the inadequate confines of the flowered halter. “I helped him up. I was sobbing when we left the bungalow. His car was outside. I drove. He sat beside me, holding his jaw, and didn’t say a word to me about what had happened. He never did until he heard that your lawyers wanted me to testify in court. He asked me not to mention that scene. You see how that would have started everybody in town talking and how bad it would have been for my reputation—my father getting in a fist fight over me. So I didn’t even tell your lawyers about that party.”

“Did you see Lily after that?”

“Of course not. You can imagine how I detested her.” She sat up and hugged her knees. “She deserved what happened to her.”

What she meant was that Lily had deserved what I had done to her. I had no desire to raise the issue. It never got anywhere with anybody.

I said: “The night Lily was killed you waited at my house for Kerry to return.”

“I thought it would be only a few minutes. It was more than au hour.”

“Were you in the house all that time?”

“For a while, but Miriam and Ursula left me alone in the living room and it was stuffy inside, so I went out in the garden to wait for Kerry.”

“Did you see or hear Ursula’s car leave or return or both? It was parked in the driveway.”

“I was sitting around the side of the house. I couldn’t see the driveway from there. I heard a car and thought it was Kerry’s and walked as far as the corner of the house. But it was Bevis so I went back to the chair.” She rested her chin on her knees and looked curiously up at me. “Why do you want to know all about these things? You needn’t be sorry that you—” Quickly she changed her mind about finishing it.

“I’m gathering material for a problem in mathematics,” I said.

“That’s over my head. What has mathematics got to do with Lily? Or is that supposed to be a wisecrack?”

I stood looking out to the road. It would be easy to drop it now. If I couldn’t face the people of West Amber, I could move to another part of the country. I had no ties, not even to my sister, when you reached my age.

Helen was telling me that she had beer on ice. I shook my head and said so long and went to my car. She stood up and watched me back the car to the road. I waved. She did not move a hand or smile. The last I saw of her she was still staring after me.

***

There was butter in the car worth a fortune in ration points and it was probably goo by now, but still I did not go home. I turned off on James Street.

George Winkler, his meaty, hairy torso stripped to the waist, was devoting the Saturday afternoon to mowing his lawn. He wiped sweat from his massive brow and asked how the boy was.

“Not bad for a murderer,” I told him.

“Oh, cut it out,” he said disgustedly. “Why don’t you go away somewhere for a few weeks?”

“What does Magee know about Lily’s former husband? When Kerry was on the witness stand and mentioned that Lily’s name had been Yard, Magee repeated the name Don Yard to himself.”

George rested his bulk on the handle of the mower. “Observant cuss, aren’t you? Don Yard is a notorious New York gambler. A very tough lad, I understand.”

“And Magee knows him?”

“Many people in New York know Don Yard or have heard of him. The fact that Lily had been married to him might have been useful at the trial to undermine her reputation further, but we’d only investigated her conduct in West Amber. We found enough for our purpose.”

“What do you know about a woman named Bertha in connection with Yard?”

“That must be Bertha Kaleman. After the trial Magee told me about Yard and mentioned her. She is probably Yard’s mistress.”

“And hated Lily because Yard wanted Lily to come back to him,” I said. “She could have come up to West Amber and murdered Lily. Or it was Don Yard because Lily refused to go back to him.”

“My God, Alec, that line of reasoning won’t leave out anybody who had ever known her. The lass inspired homicide.”

“Then there are Emil Schneider and Ogden Garback.”

“The kid’s out. We proved to our satisfaction that he hadn’t gone out with Lily since last winter.” George massaged the sweaty hair matting his chest. “Alec, you’re a mathematician.”

I laughed. “I’ve been brooding over the laws of probability.”

“That’s it—probability. Every time I see you and talk to you I’m convinced you didn’t do it. If you had, I think you’d admit it. But let’s be frank. It’s too much to believe that somebody stabbed her a minute or five minutes or ten minutes before you barged in there after events had fallen in such a way that all evidence inevitably would point to you. The odds against a coincidence like that are too great. Suppose I were to bet in a game that on the next hand I would pull a pat-hand straight flush. What odds would I ask?”

“One to 64,974.”

“I knew it was at least one to fifty thousand,” George said. “And if I pulled that straight flush, after making that bet, you’d call it a coincidence too far-fetched to be believed in.”

“I’d call it a violation of the laws of chance under the circumstances. I’d be sure you had stacked the cards, and that if you weren’t dealing, an accomplice of yours was.”

“And who,” George said softly, “would want to stack the cards against you?”

I thrust my hand deep into the pockets of my ducks to hide their trembling. “You’ve just made my point. The odds exclude everybody who wasn’t at Ursula’s house that night.” George left the support of the lawn mower and hitched his belt over his bulging belly. “What are you getting at?”

“That somebody knew that I was rushing to Lily in a high state of excitement. He or she saw an opportunity to murder Lily and frame me for the crime.”

***

George looked off to his right. Over the tops of the silver birches I saw the edge of a roof. Probably that was the bungalow in which Lily had lived. It was about the right distance and direction.

“Do you know what you’re implying?” George said, turning back to me.

I steeled myself to go on. “I walked to the bungalow. Everybody at the house had a chance to beat me to it. You, to begin with. You live only a few steps from the bungalow and you were home when I passed this house. Maybe you’d just returned from Lily’s.”

He open his mouth.

“I’m not being personal,” I cut him off. “I’m trying to set up a hypothesis. Kerry Nugent admits that he reached James Street before I did. Bevis Spencer drove his father home; he could have stopped off at Lily’s before going back to Miriam. Oliver Spencer could have walked from his house after Bevis dropped him off; it’s only half a mile and I had two miles to walk. Sheriff Dowie says he drove home and then left to drink beer, but he might have gone straight to Lily’s instead.”

“I was under the impression that mathematics was an exact science,” George said with heavy sarcasm.

“It’s good for any kind of straight thinking.” I forced myself to be ruthless. “Ursula was in the cardroom, Miriam lying down in her room, Helen Spencer around the side of the house in the garden. Any of them could have driven off in Ursula’s car which was parked in the driveway, gone to the bungalow and returned in ten minutes.”

“And the human equation?”

“You mean the motive? As you said, who didn’t have reason for killing Lily?”

“I didn’t.”

“That’s what you say. How do I know you didn’t or Kerry didn’t or even Dowie didn’t? I know why the others hated her.”

“I hated her, too,” George muttered, looking down with abstract interest at the blades of the lawn mower. “Because of what she did to you.” He lifted his shaggy head. “We started with poker. There is psychology as well as mathematics in poker and murder. Do you believe that any of the people you mentioned would be capable of deliberately framing you? Your mathematics means that or it means nothing.”

I was silent.

“I know what you’re thinking,” George went on. “At any rate, I’m thinking it. The murderer might frame you to divert suspicion from himself. But look at the risk involved. Look at the split-second timing necessary. Why not simply walk in on her one night and kill her and walk out with the reasonable assurance that her body will not be found for hours or perhaps days? By that time the trail, if any, would be cold. Too many people had a motive for the murderer to be suspected in particular. And what if he were suspected? There would be no evidence against him.” He shook his head. “No, Alec, you can’t have your killer an extremely clever and quick-thinking individual and at the same time a complete fool.”

***

He was right, of course. I had known it from the first. “I’m just starting to line up terms for my equation,” I said weakly.

George snorted. “Nuts to your mathematics! You’re not dealing with the set values of numbers, but with human beings.”

I took my hands out of my pockets They were clenched and hot. “I’m not finished. There are Schneider and Yard and Bertha Kaleman and perhaps somebody I never heard of.”

“And what’s become of your laws of chance?” George mocked.

“You were the one who suggested the fantastic odds of a straight flush. Why that hand? Why not the odds on a pair, which are little better than two to one? Or even three of a kind, forty-eight to one, which is not too improbable. Because, look. Let’s say that Lily intended to tell me something that was dangerous to somebody and the absolute necessity to kill her didn’t come to a head until I was actually in town. That lets us include Schneider and Yard and Bertha Kaleman and others. My homecoming made her murder inevitable that night. The killer had to wait for darkness; houses around the bungalow are so close that there was a risk he’d be seen coming or going by daylight. So he had to wait until nine-thirty or ten, when it was dark enough to shelter him. She was my wife; I was bound to visit her that night. In view of that there’s nothing so far-fetched in the fact that I walked in shortly after the murder.”

“You’re assuming—”

“I’m assuming unknown quantities until I learn their values.”

George Winkler studied me. “Alec, you’re not out for vengeance? You still don’t care for her?”

“Probably I’m conceited, but I don’t like to be thought of as a killer.”

“In any case,” George said, “the law has decided that the circumstances were extenuating.”

“To hell with the law!”

I went across the lawn to my car and drove home.
