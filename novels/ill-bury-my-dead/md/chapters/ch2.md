### Chapter 2

The following morning, a few minutes before nine-thirty, Chuck Eagan drove the Cadillac into the circular drive leading to Julie's Riverside apartment block. As he got out of the car, Nick English came through the revolving doors.

"Morning, Chuck," English said as he got into the car. "What's the good word?"

"I went down and talked to the janitor like you said," Chuck said. "A Joe named Tom Calhoun. He seemed a helpful sort of a guy after I had let him see some dough. Your brother had a secretary. Her name's Mary Savitt and she's got an apartment on East Tenth Street."

"Okay," English said. "Let's go there. Snap it up, Chuck. I want to catch her before she leaves."

Chuck got into the Cadillac and set it in motion. While he drove rapidly through the congested traffic, English glanced at the newspapers he had brought down with him. All of them devoted considerable space to Roy's suicide, coupling his name with Nick's.

Morilli appeared to be earning his keep. He had given out that Roy had been overworking, and it was believed that he had shot himself in a fit of depression following a nervous breakdown. The story sounded a little thin, but English was satisfied that it would stand up so long as someone didn't come along to challenge it.

English wondered irritably if he were wasting his time going to see Mary Savitt. There was a lot to do. He had to see Senator Henry Beaumont and calm his fears. He had to have a word with the Police Commissioner. He had to talk to Sam Crail, his attorney, and then there were the news hounds to deal with. But he was pretty sure if anyone knew why Roy had killed himself this girl, Mary Savitt, would know.

Chuck said, "Here we are, boss. This joint on the left."

"Don't stop at the door," English said. "Drive on half a block, and well walk back."

Chuck did as he was told, then stopped the car. The two men got out.

"You'd better come with me," English said, and set off with long, quick strides to the brown-stone apartment house that Chuck had pointed out.

A row of mailboxes in the lobby, each with the owner's name on it, told English that Mary Savitt's apartment was on the third floor. The entrance to the apartments was guarded by a door by which was a row of buzzers. Chuck thumbed the third floor button and waited for the answering buzz. Nothing happened, and after pressing the buzzer three times, he looked over at English.

"I guess the nest's empty," he said.

"She's probably seen the newspapers and has gone down to the office," English returned, frowning.

At this moment, the door to the stairs opened and a girl came into the lobby. She was smartly dressed, and she looked sleepy and pale in the hard morning light. She stared at English, and her eyes opened wide. Her fingers went hastily to her hair, tucking in a stray curl under her hat. He raised his hat

"Pardon me, I was hoping to find Miss Savitt. She's out, I guess?"

"Oh no, she's not out, Mr. English," the girl said smiling. "It is Mr. English, isn't it?"

"That's right," English returned, holding his hat in his hand. "Clever of you to recognize me."

"Oh gee! I'd know you anywhere, Mr. English. I saw *The Moon Rides High* last week. I thought it was a terrific show."

"I'm glad," English said, and somehow he managed to convey that he was glad and that her opinion was something to cherish. "Maybe Miss Savitt's still asleep. I've buzzed her three times."

"Perhaps her buzzer is on the blink," the girl said. "I know she's in. Her milk's still outside the door and her newspaper's there, too. Besides, she never leaves before ten."

"Then I guess I'll go up and knock on the door," English said. "Thank you for your help."

"You're welcome, I'm sure."

He gave her a warm, friendly smile that left her looking a little dazed, and moved past her to the stairs, followed closely by Chuck.

A bottle of milk and a folded newspaper lay outside Mary Savitt's front door.

English jerked his head towards the door, and Chuck rapped sharply on it. No one answered. Again Chuck knocked, again no one answered.

"Think you could open the door, Chuck?" English asked, lowering his voice.

For a moment Chuck looked surprised, then he examined the lock.

"Nothing to it, but maybe she'll squawk for the cops."

"Go ahead and open it," English said.

Chuck took out a small metal lever from his pocket, inserted it into the lock, fiddled for a moment, then pushed open the door.

English stepped into a neatly kept living room.

"Is anyone here?" he called, raising his voice.

He waited in silence, then crossed the room and knocked on a door facing him, then opened the door and looked into a darkened room. Enough light filtered through the drawn curtains to show him that it was a bedroom. He looked toward the bed; it was empty, and the blankets were thrown back,

"I believe she's out," he said to Chuck.

"Maybe she's having a bath," Chuck said. "Want me to go and see?"

English ignored his eagerness and moved into the bedroom, turning on the light as he did so.

He came to an abrupt standstill.

To the right of the door leading to the bedroom was another door. Against this door, and hanging by a white silk cord which had been thrown over the top of the door and fastened to something on the other side, was the body of a dark haired girl in her early twenties. She was wearing a white silk dressing gown that hung open to show a blue nylon nightgown. What beauty she might have had was spoiled now by her waxen color and her swollen tongue that protruded from her open mouth. Dried blood made a red thread from her nose to her chin.

Chuck drew in a sharp breath.

"Holy mackerel! What did she want to do that for?" he said in a tight, low voice.

"She's been dead about seven hours, at a guess," he said. "This is getting complicated, Chuck."

Chuck came and stood at his side, his eyes on the dead girl.

"It sure is," he said. "We'd better get out of here, boss."

"Shut up, will you?" English snapped, and began to move around the room.

Chuck went over to the door and waited, his small, hard eyes on English.

"On the mantelpiece, boss," he said suddenly.

English looked at the mantelpiece. On it, was a silver framed photograph of his brother Roy. Written in ink across the lower part of the photograph in his brother's large sprawling handwriting, was "*Look at me sometimes, darling, and remember what we're going to be to each other. Roy.*"

English swore softly under his breath.

"So he had to fall in love with her!" He looked over at Chuck. "He's certain to have written to her. His kind always does. Get busy and see if you can find any letters."

Chuck went into action quickly and with professional thoroughness. In a very short time he had unearthed a bundle of letters done up in a blue ribbon which he handed to English, and then continued his search.

English glanced through the letters, recognizing his brother's handwriting. He had only to read two or three of them to know that Roy and Mary had been passionately in love with each other, and that Roy had been planning to leave Corinne and go away with Mary. He shoved the letters in his pocket as Chuck closed the last drawer.

"Take a look in the other room," English said, and when Chuck had left the bedroom he picked up the framed photograph of his brother and dropped it into his pocket.

Five minutes later, English and Chuck left the apartment.

"The office. And snap it up," English said as he climbed into the car. "And keep your mouth shut about this, Chuck."

Chuck inclined his head, slid under the driving wheel and sent the Cadillac shooting uptown.

The intercom on English's vast mahogany desk buzzed into life.

"Mr. Crail is here, Mr. English," Lois told him.

"Send him in, and when he's gone, come in yourself," English said.

A moment later, the door opened and Sam Crail came in. Crail was nearly as tall as English, and immensely fat. His hair was black and thick, and smoothly oiled. His complexion was pallid, and his eyes sharp and beady. His smooth, black jowels were blue with constant shaving, and his pudgy hands were hairy, his nails immaculately manicured.

He was the smartest attorney in town, and had handled all English's legal work ever since English had begun to climb.

"Hello, Nick," he said as he pulled up a chair. "This is a bad business."

English grunted, pushed his cigar box across the desk and eyed Crail speculatively.

"Did you see Corinne last night?"

"I saw her. She's going to make trouble, Nick."

"No, she isn't," English said shortly. "What do you imagine you're on my pay roll for? It's your job to stop her making trouble."

"What do you think I've been doing ever since I got there last night?" Crail said a little heatedly. "But she won't play. Her story is that Roy was in debt. He came to you for money and you threw him out."

English snorted.

"He came to me for a loan six months ago," he said. "That's not much of a story. Why didn't he shoot himself sooner?"

"She maintains that he came to you day before yesterday."

"Then she's lying."

"Roy told her he came to you."

"Then he was lying."

"Might be difficult to prove, Nick. The press is only waiting for something to break. She says because you wouldn't help him, he had to go to some of his old clients to raise the wind. One of them phoned the police. She says you told the Police Commissioner to withdraw Roy's license. With no future in front of him, he shot himself. Her story makes you directly responsible for his death."

English frowned.

"Did Roy tell her this or is she making it up on her own?"

"She says Roy told her, and that's the story she's going to tell the coroner. The inquest's in an hour, Nick."

"Yeah." English stood up and paced over to the window. "She doesn't like me, does she?"

"No, I guess she doesn't. She says her life's ruined, and she doesn't see why yours shouldn't be, either."



II

"The fool! Why does she think that my life would be ruined by a yarn like this?" English said. Crail shrugged.

"It wouldn't ruin you, Nick, but it would cause a stink. People think you are rolling in money. Public opinion is a dangerous thing to come up against. She says Roy wanted four thousand to get him out of bis mess. Four thousand wouldn't have scratched your pile. She could make it sound pretty cheap, Nick."

"He wanted ten thousand and he wouldn't tell me why," English said. "I turned him down because I thought it was time that he stopped sponging on me. Why the hell should I keep him and his wife?"

"Sure," Crail said, "but now he's shot himself, he gets the sympathy. This could kill the hospital idea, Nick. They are only waiting for an excuse to double-cross you."

"I know." English came back to the desk. "Now listen: the story is that Roy was overworking. The business was a failure. He tried to hold it together, but it was too much for him. Instead of coming to me, he tried to handle it himself, cracked under the strain and shot himself. That's the story I've given the press this morning, and that's the story you're going to give the coroner. Corinne will go with you and back it up."

Crail looked worried.

"She won't do it. I've talked to her, and I know. She's made up her mind to be difficult,"

"She'll do it," English returned, his voice hardening. "If she doesn't like that story, then I'll give the press another she'll like a lot less. Roy had a secretary—a girl named Mary Savitt. They were lovers. They planned to run away together, and leave Corinne out on a limb. Something went wrong; probably Roy couldn't get enough money to quit. Being the weakling he was, he shot himself. The girl must have gone to the office and found him. She went home and hanged herself."

Crail stared at him.

"Hanged herself?"

"Yes. I went to talk to her this morning, and found her dead. No one knows yet. Sooner or later, they'll find her, but I'm hoping the inquest will be over before they do."

"Did anyone see you there?" Crail asked anxiously.

"I was seen going up the stairs. My story is that I rang the bell, and getting no answer, assumed that she'd gone down to the office."

"Are you sure that they were lovers?"

English opened a drawer, took out the photograph he had found in Mary Savitt's bedroom, and pushed it across the desk. He tossed the bundle of letters into Crail's lap.

"There's all the proof. If Corinne thinks she can queer my pitch by telling a sniveling yarn like this, she's got another thing coming. Tell her to toe the line or this muck goes to the press."

"This is going to be a shock to her, Nick," Crail said slowly. "She was crazy about Roy."

English regarded him, his eyes hard.

"She doesn't have to know. Persuade her to toe the line if you're all that anxious to spare her feelings."

"I guess she'll have to see these letters," Crail said. "All the same, I don't like it."

"You don't have to do the job," English said. "I can always get another attorney, Sam."

Crail shrugged his fat shoulders.

"Oh, I'll do it," he said. "I wouldn't like to be as hard as you are, Nick."

"Skip the sentiment. Did Roy leave a will?"

"Yes. He left everything to Corinne. As far as I can see, it amounts to a flock of debts. He had a safe deposit box, and I hold the key. I haven't, had time yet to examine it, but I don't expect to find anything."

"Let me know how his estate stands before you tell Corinne," English said. "We could arrange to find an insurance policy. Fix it that she has a couple of hundred bucks a week for life. I'll pay."

Crail grinned.

"Who's going soft now?" he asked, getting to his feet.

"Get over to the coroner's office," English said curtly, "and make that story stand up."

"I'll make it stand up," Crail said.



III

A minute or so after Crail had gone, Lois left her desk, crossed the room to English's office door and tapped as she opened it.

English was staring at his cigar with cold, brooding eyes. He looked up and gave her a little nod.

"Come on in and sit down," he said and hunched his massive shoulders as he leaned across the desk. "What time did you get to bed this morning?"

Lois smiled as she pulled a chair up to the desk and sat down.

"It was after four, but I don't need much sleep."

"Nonsense. Of course you do. Go home after lunch, and go to bed."

"But really, Mr. English . . ." she began.

"That's an order," he broke in curtly. "Let the work wait You're always working. Let Harry do what's necessary. Now about last night. What did you think of the setup there?"

"Not much, Mr. English. I went through all the files. There's been no new business since last August."

English frowned.

"Are you sure? Let's see—I bought the business for him in March, didn't I?"

"Yes, Mr. English. I've found correspondence dated up to July 31st, but nothing since then."

"What was he doing then for the past nine months?"

Lois shook her head.

"The place might just as well have been closed. Nothing came in and nothing went out. At least, there are no copies of letters in the files."

English rubbed bis jaw thoughtfully.

"How about his cases? Did he keep any record of those?"

"He handled sixteen cases from April to the end of July. But after that there wasn't a thing."

"What about his books?"

"There was a set in the safe. I have copies if you would like to see them."

"What was his net average take?"

"Around seventy-five a week."

English grimaced.

"How did he manage to run a home like that on seventy-five a week? You mean to tell me that since August the business hasn't made a dime?"

"He may have kept another set of books, Mr. English, but according to the ones I found, nothing came in since August."

English shrugged.

"Well, okay. What else did you find?"

"There was a card index holder in his desk. It had a few blank cards in it. I have an idea that the cards that were in use have been taken away."

English studied her, his eyes interested.

"What makes you say that?"

"From the looks of the box. The bottom of it was very dusty, and by the marks in the dust it was pretty obvious that there had been a number of cards in the box. I'm just making a guess, but it did strike me that some of the cards had been recently removed."

"Maybe the box belonged to the previous owner."

"It looked new to me, Mr. English."

English pushed back his chair and stood up, his brows wrinkled into a frown.

"It's damned funny, isn't it?" he said after a long silence. "Well, all right, Lois, thanks a lot. Sorry to have kept you out of bed so late. Be a good girl and go home after lunch."

As Lois moved to the door, the buzzer on the desk sounded. English pressed down the switch.

"Lieutenant Morilli is here, Mr. English," the receptionist said. "He would like a word."

"Harry will see him," English said. "I'm going to lunch."

"He wants to see you, Mr. English. He says it's important."

English hesitated.

"Okay, send him in. I've still got ten minutes. Tell Chuck to have the car ready."

Lois opened the door, and stood aside to let Morilli enter the office.

"You've caught me at a bad time," English said as Lois went out, shutting the door behind her. "I've got to go out in five minutes. What's on your mind?"

"I thought I ought to have a word with you," Morilli said, coming over to the desk. "We've located your brother's secretary—a girl named Mary Savitt."

English looked at him, his darkly tanned face expressionless.

"So what?"

"She's dead."

English frowned and stared at Morilli who stared back at him.

"Dead? What—suicide?"

Morilli lifted his shoulders.

"It could be murder."



IV

For a long second, English stared at Morilli, then waved him to a chair.

"Sit down, and let's hear about it."

"I telephoned Mrs. English this morning," Morilli said, sitting down, "to find out if Mr. English had a secretary. She gave me the girl's name and address. I and a sergeant went down there. She has an apartment on East Tenth Street." He paused and looked hard at English.

"I know," English said, taking his cue from Morilli's look, "I went there myself this morning. I couldn't get an answer. I thought she must have gone down to the office."

Morilli nodded.

"That's right," he said. "Miss Hopper who lives in the apartment above Miss Savitt's said she had seen you."

"Well, go on," English said curtly. "What happened?"

"We didn't get an answer to our buzz. There was a bottle of milk and a newspaper outside the door, and that made me suspicious. We got the passkey and found her hanging on the bathroom door."

English pushed his cigar box across the desk after taking one himself.

"Go ahead and help yourself," he said. "What's this about murder?"

"On the face of it, it looked like suicide," Morilli said. "The

police surgeon said it was a typical suicide." He rubbed his

bony nose and added softly, "And he still thinks it's suicide."

Then he went on, "After the body was removed, I had a look around the room. I was on my own, Mr. English, and I made a discovery. Near the bed was a damp patch on the carpet as if it had been recently washed. When I examined it carefully, I found a small stain. I gave it a benzidine test. It was a bloodstain."

English took his cigar from between his lips and frowned at the glowing end.

"I don't reckon to be as smart as you, Lieutenant, but I fail to see how that makes it murder."

Morilli smiled.

"A faked suicide is often very difficult to spot, Mr. English," he said. "We're trained to look for the giveaway. That stain on the carpet was a pretty complete giveaway. You see, when I cut the girl down, I noticed that she had bled from the nose. There were no marks on her negligee, and I expected to find at least a drop or two of blood somewhere. Then I found a stain on the floor. That tells me she died on the floor, and not hanging from the door."

English pursed his lips.

"You mean she was strangled on the floor?"

"That's right. If someone surprised her, slipped the dressing gown cord around her throat and tightened it, she would have lost consciousness very quickly. She would have fallen face downward on the carpet; and while the killer was exerting pressure on the cord, it is likely she would bleed from the nose, making a stain on the carpet. Having killed her, it would be simple for him to string her up against the bathroom door to make it look like suicide."

English thought about this, then nodded.

"I guess that's right. So you think it's murder?"

"I won't swear to it, but how else did the stain get on the carpet?"

"You're sure it's blood?"

"No doubt about it."

English glanced at his wrist watch. He was already four minutes late for his appointment.

"Well, thanks for telling me, Lieutenant," he said. "This is unexpected. I don't know what to make of it. Maybe we can talk about it later on. Right now I have a date with the Senator." He got to his feet. "I've got to be running, along."

Morilli didn't move. He sat looking up at English, an odd expression in his eyes that English didn't like.

"What's on your mind?" English asked curtly.

"It's up to you, Mr. English, but I should have thought that you would have wanted to settle this business right now. I haven't put in my report yet, but I'll have to within the next half hour."

English frowned.

"What's your report got to do with me?"

"That's for you to say," Morilli returned, carefully. "I like to help you where I can, Mr. English. You've always been pretty good to me."

English had a sudden idea that there was something very wrong behind Morilli's visit.

He leaned forward and flicked down the intercom switch.

"Lois? Get hold of the Senator and tell him I'm going to be late. I shan't be with him until two o'clock."

"Yes, Mr. English."

He released the switch and sat down again.

"Go ahead, Lieutenant; keep talking," he said, his voice hard and quiet.

Morilli hitched his chair forward, and looking English straight in the face, said, "I don't have to tell you how the D.A. feels about Senator Beaumont. They've been sworn enemies ever since the Senator got into office. If the D.A. can do anything to discredit the Senator, he's going to do it. Everyone knows you're behind the Senator. If the D.A. can make things tough for you, he'll do it in the hope it'll eventually hit the Senator. If he can involve you in a scandal, he's not going to be too particular how he does it"

"For a Lieutenant of Homicide, you keep remarkably well informed about politics," English said. "All right, we'll take that as read. What has it got to do with Mary Savitt?"

"It could have plenty to do with her," Morilli said. "Doc Richards told me your brother died between nine and half past ten last night. He couldn't put it nearer than that. He says Mary Savitt died between ten o'clock and midnight Miss Hopper tells me she saw your brother leave Mary Savitt's apartment at nine forty-five last night. It's not going to take the D.A. long to arrive at the conclusion that these two had a suicide pact; that your brother murdered the girl, then went down to his office and shot himself. If he does arrive at that conclusion there's going to be quite a stink in the press, and it's going to come this way and bounce off you on to the Senator."

English sat still for a long moment, staring at Morilli, his eyes like granite.

"Why are you telling me all this, Lieutenant?" he asked at last.

Morilli lifted his shoulders; his small, dark eyes shifted away from English's face.

"No one but me knows it's murder, Mr. English. Doc Richards says it's suicide, but then he didn't see the stain on the carpet. If he knew about that, he'd change his mind, but he doesn't know, nor does the D.A."

"But they'll know when you have put in your report," English said.

"I guess they will unless I forget to mention the bloodstain."

English studied Morilli's white, expressionless face.

"There's Miss Hopper's evidence," he said. "You say she saw Roy leave the apartment. If she starts talking, the D.A. will investigate. He might even find the stain."

Morilli smiled.

"You don't have to worry about Miss Hopper," he said. "I've taken care of her. I happen to know what she does in her spare time. She wouldn't want to go on the stand. Some smart lawyer like Sam Crail might turn her inside out. I mentioned that fact to her. She isn't going to talk."

English leaned forward.

"You realize that the chances are a hundred to one that Roy killed the girl, don't you?" he said quietly. "If she was murdered, then someone is going to get away with it, if it wasn't Roy."

Morilli shrugged.

"It'll be your brother who murdered her if the D.A. hears about the stain, Mr. English. You can bet your bottom dollar on it. Either way, the killer gets away with it." He made a little gesture with his hand. "It's up to you. I'll put the stain in my report on your say-so, but since you've taken care of me in the past, I thought it was only right that I should give you a break when the chance came my way."

English looked at him.

"That's pretty nice of you, Lieutenant. I shan't forget it. Maybe it would be better to forget about the stain."

"Just as you say," Morilli said, getting to his feet. "Only too glad to be of help, Mr. English."

"Let me see," English said absently, "you have a bet to collect, haven't you? How much was it, Lieutenant?"

Morilli ran his thumb along his narrow, starkly black moustache before saying, "Five thousand, Mr. English."

English smiled.

"Was it as much as that?"

"I guess that was the sum," Morilli returned, his face expressionless.

"In that case, I'd better pay you. I always believe in paying my debts."

English stood up and went over to the wall safe. He opened it and took out two bundles of bills and tossed them on the desk. "I won't ask for a receipt."

"You won't need one," Morilli returned, picked up the two bundles, checked the amount with a quick flick of his fingers and crammed them away in his coat pockets.

"Of course, the D.A. might not trust your report," English said, going back to the desk and sitting down. "He might send up one of his people to check the room, and he might find the stain."

Morilli smiled.

"I like to kid myself that my service to you, Mr. English, is a pretty good one. The stain doesn't exist any more. I've fixed it." He moved over to the door. "Well, I'd better get over to the station house and write my report."

"So long, Lieutenant," English said. When Morilli had gone, English drew in a deep breath. "Well, I'll be damned!" he said softly. "The blackmailing sonofabitch!"



V

A few minutes after six o'clock, the same evening, and after English had finished dictating the last letter of the day, Lois put her head around the door to tell him Sam Crail was waiting, and wanted to see him.

English glanced at his wrist watch. He had promised to pick up Julie at half past six.

"Send him in," he said, "and go home yourself. You should have been gone hours ago."

"Yes, Mr. English," Lois said, and turned to beckon to Crail who was impatiently waiting behind the barrier.

"Come on in, Sam," English said as he caught sight of him. "You'd better ride down with me. I promised Julie I'd take her to a movie tonight."

"I don't imagine you'll want to go to any movie when you've heard what I'm going to tell you," Crail said, lowering his bulk into an armchair.

English stared at him.

"I've opened Roy's deposit box," Crail said. "There's twenty thousand dollars in it—in cash."

English gaped.

"Twenty thousand?"

"Yep, in hundred bills. How do you like that?"

"Where did he get it?"

Crail shook his head.

"Search me. I thought you'd want to know right away."

"Yes." English stood staring down at the carpet rubbing the back of his neck with his hand while his eyes brooded, then shrugging, he went over to the telephone, lifted it and said, "Get me Miss Clair's apartment, will you, Lois?"

Crail reached out and helped himself to a cigar.

"I could do with a drink if there's one within sight," he said. "I've had quite a day."

English motioned to the cabinet that stood against the wall.

"Help yourself." Then into the telephone, he went on, "Julie? I'm held up again. Yeah, I'm sorry but I can't make that movie. That's the way it is. Sam's just come in—about Roy. I'll tell you later. Sorry, Julie. I seem to be always standing you up. What are you going to do? Look, would you like , Harry to go with you?" He listened for a moment, frowning, then said, "Well, all right. I thought maybe you'd like a little company. I'll meet you at the club at nine. So long for now."

Crail passed him a whiskey and soda.

"You know your business best, Nick," he said, "but I'll be damned if I'd let an attractive girl like Julie go to the movies with Harry Vince—he's far too good-looking."

"Put your mind at rest, Sam. She isn't going with him. She prefers to wait until I can take her. What else did you find  in  the  deposit  box?"

Crail lit his cigar and blew carefully on the lighted end.

"Looks as if he was ready to skip," he said. "There were two airplane tickets to Los Angeles, the money, his will and a gold and platinum wedding ring."

"How the devil did he manage to lay his hands on all that money?" English asked.

"Why the devil did he commit suicide?" Crail said. 'That's the important question."

English nodded. He sat silent for several moments, then asked abruptly, "How did Corinne take it, Sam?"

Crail grimaced.

"It hit her hard, but she finally toed the line. I'm sorry for that girl. All right, she's dumb, but I didn't like telling her about Roy. But you'd better keep an eye on her. If she could do you dirt, she'd do it"

English lifted his broad shoulders.

"She and twenty thousand other people. So, what? Did the coroner take it all right?"

"Sure. All he wanted was a good reason, and I gave it to him—nervous depression brought on by overwork."

English reached forward and took a cigar.

"Mary Savitt was murdered, Sam."

Crail stiffened.

"What makes you say that?"

"I had a visit from Lieutenant Morilli. You know Morilli?" Crail nodded.

"He's worked it out as murder," English said, and went On to tell Crail about the bloodstain on the carpet.

"Was it Roy?" Crail asked, his fat face alarmed.

"Why do you say that?"

"I don't know," Crail returned, frowning. "The idea automatically jumped into my mind. Let me see: those two were lovers. They were going away. Maybe the girl suddenly decided it wasn't good enough. Roy was married. She would be left out on a limb. She says she's not going at the last moment. Roy loses his temper, and strangles her, then makes it look like suicide. He goes down to his office, gets cold feet, and shoots himself."

English smiled. His eyes turned frosty.

"You worked that one out fast enough."

"And so will the D.A.," Crail said slowly. "This is bad, Nick."

"Not as bad as it sounds. Morilli's agreed to keep his mouth shut. I gave him five thousand."

Crail whistled softly.

"That copper has big ideas."

"Anyone worth a damn has big ideas. He's pulled me out of a nasty jam."

"Do you think it was Roy?"

English shook his head.

"Not a chance. Roy wouldn't kill anyone. I knew him as well as I know myself. And another thing—Roy wouldn't kill himself either." He got to his feet and began to pace the floor. "If Mary Savitt was murdered, Roy was murdered too. How do you like that?"

"Why, that's crazy! The police say Roy shot himself. His prints . . ."

"Be your age, Sam. Someone faked Mary Savitt's suicide. Someone also faked Roy's suicide."

"Who would want to kill Roy?"

English spread out his hands.

"A lot of people, Sam. Roy wasn't an endearing type."

"That's right But who would want to kill the girl? Why the girl?"

"I don't know. Maybe Roy was blackmailing someone. Maybe Mary Savitt knew the details. They worked together in the office. Maybe the killer thought he'd be safe and wipe both out It could be, Sam."

Crail took a shot of whiskey.

"How about Corinne?" he asked. "The outraged wife angle. She has the motive if those two really were murdered."

English shook his head.

"No. Corinne wouldn't have had the strength to hoist that girl up against the bathroom door. It isn't the kind of setup a woman would tackle."

"Maybe she got someone to do it."

Again English shook his head.

"You're forgetting the twenty thousand. That could be blackmail money, Sam. Suppose Roy had been blackmailing someone in a big way, and decided to make a final killing before he went away. Suppose he turned the screw too far. Suppose the guy he was blackmailing decided he'd stop Roy once and for all, and while he was about it stop Mary Savitt too. If you're looking for a theory, try that one on for size."

Crail scratched the side of his fat neck with a carefully manicured fingernail.

"Are you going to talk to Morilli about this?"

"No. Do you think I want my brother branded as a blackmailer?"

Crail shrugged.

"Maybe the killer figured that the thing would be hushed up for just that reason. If he did, he's played it smart"

English showed his teeth in a mirthless smile.

"I wouldn't be surprised. Have you told Corinne about the money, Sam?"

Crail shook his head.

"I thought I'd better talk to you first."

"You did right. Sit on that money for a while. Keep it in the safe deposit box. In the meantime, go ahead with, that insurance idea of mine. See Corinne's fixed up, and let me know what I owe you. If that money turns out to be from blackmail, Corinne mustn't have anything to do with it."

"Okay, I'll fix it," Crail said. "One more thing, Nick. I've had an offer for the business. Four thousand—cash down! Want me to sell?"

English paused in his pacing and turned around.

"Who's the buyer?"

Crail shrugged.

"It's come through Hurst. He wouldn't say."

"He's a lawyer, isn't he?"

"That's what he calls himself. I have another name for him."

"Four thousand?"

"That's right. Corinne wants to sell."

"How does she know about it before I do?"

"Hurst went direct to her. He called at nine o'clock this morning. He didn't want to deal with me. Fortunately. She put him on to me. I told her to wait a few days. I said we were sure to get a better offer."

"Tell Hurst the business isn't for sale. I'll find a buyer for you, and the price is seven thousand. Tell Corinne, and give her your O.K. Do it first thing tomorrow morning."

"Who's the buyer?" Crail asked, staring.

"His name's Ed Leon. He'll call on you sometime tomorrow, give you his check, and all the details you want," English said. "And remember, Sam, I don't know Leon and he doesn't know me. Understand?"

"Now wait a minute, Nick. Don't keep me in the dark."

English came over and stood in front of Crail.

"Someone killed Roy. Someone wants to buy Roy's business in a hurry. I want to find out if the killer and the buyer are the same. Ed Leon's the guy to find out for me."

"Well, you know best, but what can you do if you find the killer?"

English's cold, brooding eyes stared at Crail for a long minute.

"This is a personal matter. Someone killed my brother. I don't like that. If the police can't take care of it, then I'll bury my own dead. That's what I can do about it."

Crail got to his feet.

"Watch out, Nick," he said seriously. "That kind of talk is dangerous. If you took my advice, you'd let it lie. You have too many commitments to start a caper like that. Let's face it. Roy didn't mean a thing to you. If you start to dig up his past, you may find something that you can't bury again. Suppose he was a blackmailer? Wouldn't it be better to forget about it? You've got the future to think of."

English slapped Crail on his broad back.

"I know you mean well, Sam, but even if Roy was a louse, he was my brother. No one's going to murder him and get away with it. I'll work it so that it remains a personal matter between me and the killer. Take care of Corinne, and I'll take care of Roy's killer."

When Crail had gone, English went into the outer office. Lois was still there, busily writing in English's appointment book.

"For the love of Pete! Didn't I tell you to go home hours ago?" English said, coming over to her.

"I guess you did, but I thought I'd stay on until you were ready to go."

"I don't know what I'd do without you, Lois," English said, standing beside her and looking down at her glossy, dark head.

She smiled, pleased.

"See if you can get Ed Leon. He's in Chicago some place. I don't know his number."

"I'll get him for you," Lois said, and turned briskly to the switchboard.

English went back to his office and closed the door. He began to pace up and down, his face thoughtful. Ten minutes later, the telephone rang.

"Mr. Leon's on the line now, Mr. English," Lois told him.

"Good girl. Put him on, will you?"

There was a click, and English said, "That you, Ed?"

"Well, if it isn't, some other louse is wearing my suit," a voice said in his ear. "What's on your mind?"

"I want you," English said. "Catch the first plane out tomorrow morning. I have a job that's right up your street."

"I don't want a job. I want to be left in peace," Leon said.

"I said I want you," English snapped. "This is a big job. Ed. Something right up your street or I wouldn't have called you. When you reach town, give me a call. I'll meet you somewhere. I don't want anyone to know you and I are working together. Do you understand?"

"Not a word," said Leon, sighing, "but if it's like that, I guess I'll have to do something about it. Is there any money in it for me?"

"Five grand," English said.

Leon gave a long, low whistle.

"The buzzing you hear in your ears is.my helicopter landing on your roof," he said excitedly, and hung up.
