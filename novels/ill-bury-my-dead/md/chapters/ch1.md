### Chapter 1

Harry Vince came into the outer office, and hurriedly shut the door behind him, cutting off the uproar of men's voices, the sound of raucous laughter and the shuffling of many feet.

"Sounds like a zoo in there, doesn't it? And—phew! it smells like one too," he said as he crossed the room to where Lois Marshall sat at the telephone switchboard. He carried a bottle of champagne and two glasses which he set down carefully on a near-by desk. "Mr. English says that you are to have some champagne. So here it is."

"I don't think I want any, thank you," Lois said, smiling at him. She was a trim, good looking girl around twenty six or seven, dark, with severe eyebrows, steady brown eyes and the minimum of make-up. "I'm not mad about the stuff—are you?"

"Only when someone else pays for it," Vince returned when he expertly broke the wire cage and thumbed over the cork. "Besides, this is an occasion. We don't win the Light Heavyweight Championship every day."

The cork sailed across the room with a resounding pop! and he hurriedly poured the foaming wine into the two glasses.

"Thank goodness we don't," Lois said. "How long do you think they are going to stay in there?"

"Until they are kicked out They haven't finished the whiskey yet." He handed her a glass. "Here's to Joe Ruthlin, the new Champ."

"Here's to Mr. English," Lois said quietly and raised her glass.

"Okay. Here's to Mr. English."

They drank, and Vince grimaced and lit a cigarette. "He has the magic touch. It doesn't seem to matter what he takes on: he has to make a success of it. Fight promotion this week; a circus last week, a musical the week before that. What's he going to do next?"

Lois laughed.

"He'll find something." She looked up at Vince, seeing a square shouldered man of medium height, around thirty-three, with a crew cut, pale brown eyes that looked worried and uneasy, a good mouth and chin and a straight narrow nose. "You've done pretty well for yourself, too, Harry."

He nodded.

"Thanks to Mr. English. You know, sometimes I just can't believe I'm his general manager. I can't make out why the devil he ever gave me the job."

"He has a good eye for talent," Lois said. "He didn't give you the job because he liked the way you wear your clothes, Harry."

Vince ran his fingers through his close-cut hair. "Look at the awful hours we keep." He glanced at his wrist watch. "Eleven fifteen. This shindig's going on until two o'clock at least." He finished his champagne, waved the bottle at Lois. "Have some more?"

"No, thank you. Does he seem to be enjoying himself?"

"You know what he's like. He's been standing around all evening watching the other guys drink. He acts as if he has just dropped in on somebody else's party."

The telephone buzzer sounded. Lois pushed in a plug and picked up the harness she had laid on the desk.

"English Promotions," she said. "Good evening."

She listened while Vince watched her.

"I'll ask him to speak to you, Lieutenant," she said, and laid down the harness. "Harry, would you tell Mr. English that Lieutenant Morilli of the Homicide Bureau is calling?"

"These coppers!" Vince said, grimacing. "Wants some favor, I bet. You don't want me to disturb Mr. English to talk to that chiseler, do you?"

She nodded, her eyes serious.

"Please tell him it's urgent, Harry."

He gave her a quick look, then slid off the desk.

"Okay."

He went across the big room and pushed open the door that led into Nick English's private office.

Lois said, "I'm getting Mr. English now."

At the other end of the line, Morilli grunted.

"Better get his car at the door, Miss Marshall," he said. "When he hears what I've got to tell him he'll want some fast action."

Lois thanked him, plugged in another line and told the garage attendant who answered to have Mr. English's car at the front entrance right away.

As she pulled out the plug, Nick English came out of his office, followed by Vince.

English was six foot three in his socks, and broad, giving the appearance of massiveness without fat. He was on the right side of forty, and his hair was gypsy black, cut short and inclined to curl. There were white streaks each side of his temples that helped to soften an otherwise hard and relentless face. He had a high broad forehead, a short blunt nose, a thin mouth and a square dimpled chin. His eyes were wide set, pale blue and piercing. He was good-looking without being handsome, and gave an immediate impression of granite hard strength.

Lois moved away from the switchboard, indicating a telephone on a near-by desk.

"Lieutenant Morilli is on that line, Mr. English."

English lifted the receiver. "What's on your mind, Lieutenant?"

Lois moved quietly over to Vince.

"Better get Chuck out here, Harry. I think he'll be needed."

Vince nodded.

Lois heard English say, "When did it happen?"

She looked anxiously at the big man as he leaned over the desk, frowning into space, his long fingers tapping on the blotter.

She had known Nick English now for five years. She had first met him after he had thrown up an engineering job in South America and had opened a small office in Chicago to promote a gyroscope compass he had invented to be used in petroleum drilling operations. He had engaged her to run the office while he had walked the streets in search of the necessary capital to manufacture the compass.

She had quickly learned that difficulties and disappointments only made English work harder. There had been times when she had gone without salary and he had gone without food. His optimism and determination had been infectious. She knew he must succeed. No one who worked as hard as he did could fail. But it had been a year of constant setbacks, and that forged a link between them that she had never forgotten, but at times, she wondered, if he had forgotten. Finally the compass had been financed and had proved a success. English had sold his invention for two hundred thousand dollars plus a royalty on future sales that still brought him in a comfortable income.

He had then looked around for other inventions to promote, and during the next three years he had built up a reputation as a man who could get money out of a stone. With his newly acquired capital, he branched out and went into the entertainment business, promoting small shows and night-club cabarets, and then moving on to bigger and more ambitious shows.

Money began to pour in, and he formed companies. More money poured in and he took over the lease of two theaters and a dozen night clubs. Later, when money became almost an embarrassment, he moved into the political field. It was his money that put Senator Henry Beaumont into power and was keeping him in office.

Looking at English now, Lois realized just how far he had come and what a power he had become and, woman-like, she had regretted his rise to a height where she could no longer be of real use to him, when she was just one of many who served him.

Vince came out of the inner office with Chuck Eagan who drove English's car and did any job that English wanted done without argument or question.

Chuck was a small, jockey-sized man in his late thirties. He had sandy colored hair, a red, freckled face, stony eyes and quick, smooth movements. A tuxedo didn't suit him.

"What's up?" he asked out of the side of bis mouth, edging up to Lois.

She shook her head at him.

English said into the telephone mouthpiece, "I'll be right over. Leave things as they are until I get there."

Chuck stifled a groan.

"The car?" he asked, looking at Lois.

"At the door," she told him.

English hung up. As he turned, the three stiffened slightly, their eyes on him, waiting for instructions. His solid, suntanned face told them nothing, but bis blue eyes were hard as he said, "Get the car, Chuck. I want to get out of here right away."

"It's waiting, boss," Chuck said. "Ill meet you downstairs." And he went out of the room.

"Let these wolves finish the case of Scotch, and then get rid of them," English said to Vince. "Tell them I've been called away."

"Yes, Mr. English," Vince said, and went into the inner office.

"Stick around, will you?" he said to Lois. "I may need you tonight. If you don't hear from me within an hour, go home."

"Yes." She looked searchingly at him. "Has something happened, Mr. English?"

He looked at her, then moving over to her, he put his hand on her hip and smiled.

"Did you ever meet my brother, Roy?"

She showed her surprise as she shook her head.

"You haven't missed anything." He gave her hip a little pat. "He's just shot himself."

She caught her breath sharply.

"Oh . . . I'm sorry."

"Save it," he said, throwing his coat over his arm and moving towards the door. "He doesn't deserve your sympathy and he wouldn't want mine. This could be messy. If the papers get it, stall them. Tell them you don't know where I am."



II

Chuck Eagan swung the big, glittering Cadillac into a downtown side street.

Halfway down the block on the right he saw two prowl cars parked outside a tall building that was in darkness, except for two lighted windows on the sixth floor.

He drew up behind the parked cars, cut the engine and got out as Nick English opened the rear door and untangled his long legs to the sidewalk.

Chuck looked enquiringly at him.

"Want me to come up, boss?"

"May as well. Keep in the background and keep your mouth shut"

English walked across the sidewalk to where two patrolmen stood either side of the entrance to the building. They both saluted.

"The Lieutenant's waiting for you, Mr. English," one of them said.

English nodded and walked into the dark lobby. He moved through a smell of garbage, faulty plumbing and the acid reek of stale perspiration. Facing the entrance was an ancient elevator scarcely big enough to hold four people. Chuck slid back the grill and followed English into the elevator. He thumbed the automatic button, and the cage started its jerky ascent.

English had left his overcoat in the car. He stood solidly on the balls of his feet, his hands thrust into the pockets of his tuxedo, a smoldering cigar between his teeth, his eyes brooding and cold.

Chuck glanced at him, then looked away.

Eventually the elevator jerked to a stop at the sixth floor and Chuck pulled back the grill.

English stepped into a dimly lit passage. Almost opposite him was an open door through which a light came, throwing a square of brightness on the dirty rubber floor of the passage. Further along the passage to the left was another door, showing a light through a frosted panel. To his right, at the end of the passage was yet another door without glass. A light showed under the gap between the bottom of the door and the floor.

Lieutenant Morilli came through the open doorway. He was a thickset man in his late forties. His lean face was pallid, and his small moustache looked startlingly black against his white complexion.

"Sorry to break up the party, Mr. English," he said, his voice pitched low, "but I thought you'd want to come down." He had the hushed, deferential manner of an undertaker dealing with a wealthy client. "A tough break."

English grunted.

"Who found him?"

"The janitor. He was checking to see if all the offices were locked. He called me, and I called you. I haven't been here myself much more than twenty minutes."

English made a sign to Chuck to stay where he was, and then walked into the shabby little outer office. Across the frosted panel of the door was the legend:

*The Alert Agency*

*Chief Investigator: Roy English*

The room contained a desk, a typist chair, a covered type-Writer, a filing cabinet and a strip of carpet. On the walls hung dusty handcuffs and faded testimonials in narrow black frames, some of them dated as far back as 1927.

"He's in the other room," Morilli said, following English into the outer office.

Two plain-clothes detectives stood around awkwardly. English nodded at them, then walked across the room and paused in the doorway that led to the inner office.

The room was a little larger than the outer office. A worn and dusty rug covered the floor. A big desk took up most of the room space. A shabby armchair stood near the desk.

English's eyes swept quickly over these details, noting with a little grimace the sordidness of the room.

His brother had been seated at the desk when he had died. He now lay across the desk, his head on the blotter, one arm hanging lifelessly, his fingers just touching the carpet. His head and face rested in a pool of blood that had conveniently dripped into the metal trash basket on the floor.

English looked at his brother for a few seconds, his face expressionless, his eyes brooding. Morilli watched him from the doorway.

English walked over to the desk, leaned forward to see the man's face more clearly. His shoe touched something hard, lying on the floor, and he glanced down. A .38 Police Special lay within a few inches of the lifeless fingers.

English stepped back.

"How long has he been dead?" he asked abruptly.

"A couple of hours, at a guess," Morilli told him. "No one heard the shot. There's a news service agency down the passage. The teletypers were working at the time, and the noise deadened the shot."

"That his gun?"

Morilli lifted his shoulders.

"It could be. He has a pistol permit. I'll have it checked." His eyes searched English's face. "I don't think that there's much doubt that it was suicide, Mr. English."

English moved around the room, his hands still in his pockets. The fragrant smell of his cigar followed him as he moved.

"What makes you say that?"

"Things I've heard. He was short of money."

English stopped walking up and down and fixed Morilli with his cold, hard eyes.

"Don't let me hold you up any longer, Lieutenant."

"I thought I'd wait until you came," Morilli said uncomfortably.

"I've seen all I want to see. Ill wait in the car. When you're through, let me know. I want to have a look at his papers."

"It could take an hour, Mr. English. Would you want to wait that long?"

English frowned. "Have you told his wife yet?" he asked, jerking his head at the still body across the desk.

"I've told no one but you, Mr. English. Would you like me to take care of his wife? I could send an officer."

English shook his head.

"I guess I'll see her." He hesitated, his frown deepening. "Maybe you don't know it, but Roy and I haven't exactly hit it off recently. I don't even know his home address."

"I've got it here," Morilli said, his face expressionless. He picked up a wallet on the desk. "I went through his pockets as a matter of form." He handed English a card. "Know where it is?"

English read the card.

"Chuck will." He flicked the card with his fingernail. "Did he have any money on him?"

"Four bucks," Morilli said.

English took the wallet from Morilli's hand, glanced into it, then put it in his pocket.

"I'll see his wife. Can you get one of your men to clean up here? I may be sending someone down to check his files."

"Ill fix it, Mr. English."

"So you heard he was short of money," English said. "How did you hear that, Lieutenant?"

Morilli scratched the side of his jaw; his dark eyes uneasy.

"The Commissioner mentioned it. He knew I knew him, and he told me to have a word with him. I was going to see him tomorrow."

"A word about what?"

Morilli looked away.

"He had been worrying people for money."

"What people?"

"Two or three clients he had worked for last year. They complained to the Commissioner. I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. English, but he was going to lose his license."

English nodded his head. His eyes narrowed.

"So the Commissioner wanted you to talk to him. Why didn't the Commissioner speak to me instead of to you, Lieutenant?"

"I told him he should," Morilli said, a faint flush rising up his neck and flooding his pale face. "But he isn't an easy man to talk to."

English smiled suddenly; it wasn't a pleasant smile.

"Nor am I."

As English crossed to the door, Morilli went on, "I hear your boy won his fight. Congratulations."

English paused.

"That's right. By the way I told Vince to put a bet on for you. A hundred's brought you three. Look in tomorrow and see Vince." His eyes met Morilli's. "Okay?"

Morilli flushed.

"Why, that's pretty nice of you, Mr. English. I meant to lay a bet . . ."

"Yeah, but you didn't have the time. I know how it is. Well, I didn't forget you. Glad you won."

He walked into the outer office, and into the passage. He jerked his head at Chuck and stepped into the elevator.



III

English had only met Roy's wife once, and that casually at a cocktail party more than a year ago. He remembered he hadn't thought much of her, but was prepared to admit prejudice.

Chuck had turned off the main road, and was driving with easy assurance down an avenue lined on either side by small bungalows.

"This is the joint, boss," he said suddenly. "The white house by the lamppost."

He slowed down, swung the car to the curb and pulled up outside a small, white bungalow.

A light showed in one of the upper rooms through the drawn curtains.

English got out of the car, hunching his broad shoulders against the cold wind. He stood on the porch waiting, waiting, after he'd knocked on the door. Then he heard someone coming, and the door opened a few inches on the chain.

"Who is that?" a woman's voice asked sharply.

"Nick English," he returned.

"Who?" He caught the startled note in her voice.

"Roy's brother," he said, feeling a surge of irritation run through him at having to associate himself with Roy.

The chain slid back and the door opened and an overhead light flashed up.

Looking at Corinne, he found himself thinking she would probably look like this in thirty years' time. She was small and very blonde, and her body was pleasantly plump with provocative curves. She was wearing a rose pink silk wrap over black lounging pajamas. When she saw he was looking at her, her fingers went hastily to her corn-colored curls, patting them swiftly while she stared up at him with a surprised, rather vacant expression in her big eyes that reminded him of the eyes of a startled baby.

"Hello, Corinne," he said. "Can I come in?"

"Well, I don't know," she said. "Roy's not back yet I'm alone. Did you want to see him?"

He restrained his irritation with an effort.

"I think I had better come in," he said as gently as he could. "You'll catch cold standing there. I'm afraid I have some bad news."

"Oh?" Her eyes opened a trifle wider. "Hadn't you better see Roy? I don't think I want to hear any bad news. Roy doesn't like me to be worried."

He thought how typical that was of her. She could live in this smart litle bungalow, dress like a Hollywood starlet while Roy was apparently desperate for money, and could say without shame that he didn't want her to be worried.

"You'll catch cold," he said and moved forward, riding her back into the little lobby. He closed the door. "I'm afraid that this bad news is for you." "

He saw her face tighten with sudden fear, but before she could speak he went on, "Let's go in the living room and sit down for a moment."

She went past him into a long, low pitched room. The modern furniture was new and cheap looking, but it made a brave show. In the hard light of a standing lamp, he noticed her rose pink wrap was a Utile grubby at the collar and cuffs.

"I think we ought to wait until Roy comes in," she said, lacing and unlacing her small, plump fingers. He could see that she was desperately anxious to avoid any responsibility or to have to make any decision.

"It's because of Roy I've come," he said quietly, and turned to look at her. "Sit down, please. I wish I could spare you this, but you've got to know sooner or later."

"Oh!"

She sat down suddenly as if the strength had gone out of her legs, and her face went white under her careful make-up.

"Is—is he in trouble?" she asked.

He shook his head.

"No, he's not in trouble. It's worse than that." He wanted to be brutal and tell her that Roy was dead, but looking at the doll-like face, seeing the terror in the baby blue "eyes, the childish quivering of her lips, the sudden clenching of her fists, made it impossible for him to shock her with the straight facts.

"Is he hurt?" She met his eyes and flinched back as if he had threatened to hit her. "He's—not dead?"

"Yes, he's dead," English replied. "I'm sorry, Corinne. I wish I didn't have to tell you. If there's anything I can do ..."

"Dead?" she repeated. "He can't be dead!"

"Yes," English said.

"But he can't be dead," she repeated, her voice going shrill. "You're saying this to frighten me! You never did like me! Don't pretend you did. He can't be dead!"

"He shot himself," English said quietly.

She stared at him. He could see at once that she believed him. Her doll-like little face seemed to fall to pieces. She dropped back against the couch, her hand across her eyes.

He looked around the room, then crossed over to an elaborate cabinet that stood against the wall. He opened it and found an array of liquor bottles and glasses. He poured a shot of brandy into a glass and went over to her.

"Drink this."

He had to hold the glass to her lips, but she managed to get some of the brandy down before pushing his hand away.

"He shot himself?" she said, looking at him.

He nodded.

"Have you anyone who will stay with you tonight?" he asked, not liking the dazed horror in her eyes. "You can't be left here alone."

"But I am alone now," she said, and tears began to run down her face, smearing her make-up. "Oh, Roy! Roy! How could you do it? How could you leave me alone?"

It was the anguished cry of a child, and it disturbed English. He put his hand gently on her shoulder, but she threw it off so violently that he stepped back, startled.

"Why did he shoot himself," she demanded, looking up at him.

'Try to get it out of your mind for tonight," he said. "Would you like me to send someone to you? My secretary. . . ."

"I don't want your secretary!" She got unsteadily to her feet "And I don't want you! You killed Roy! If you had been a decent brother to him, he would never have done it!"

He was so surprised by the suddenness of this attack, and of her expression of hatred as she looked at him that he remained motionless, staring at her.

"You and your money!" she went on, her voice strident. "That's all you've ever thought about! You didn't care what happened to Roy. You didn't bother to find out how he was getting on! When he came to you for help, you threw him out! Now you've forced him to kill himself. Well, I hope you're satisfied! 1 hope you're happy you've saved some of your dirty money! Now, get out. Don't ever come here again. I hate you!"

"You mustn't talk like that," English said quietly. "It's quite untrue. If I had known Roy was in a jam, I would have helped him. I didn't know."

"You didn't care, you mean!" she cried shrilly. "You haven't spoken to him for six months. When he asked you for a loan, you told him you weren't giving him another cent. Do you call that helping him?"

"I've been helping Roy ever since he left college," English said, his voice hardening. "I thought it was high time he stood on his own feet. Did he expect me to keep him all his life?"

"Get out!" She stumbled to the door and threw it open. "Get out and stay out! And don't try to offer me any of your dirty money, because I won't take it! Now, get out!"

English lifted his heavy shoulders in a despairing shrug. He guessed that as soon as he had gone, she would collapse, and he was reluctant to leave her alone.

"Haven't you someone . . ." he began, but she broke in, screaming, "Get out! Get out! I don't want your filthy help or your sympathy. You're worse than a murderer. Get out!"

He saw it was hopeless to do anything, and he went past her into the lobby. As he opened the front door, he heard her sobbing, and he glanced back. She had thrown herself face down on the couch, her head in her arms.

He shook his head, hesitated, then opened the door and walked down the path to the car.



IV

Chuck swung the big car into the circular drive that led to an imposing apartment block overlooking the river, and brought it to a standstill before the entrance.

He got out and held the door open.

"I want to find out if my brother had a secretary or someone to help him in the office," English said as he got out of the car. "Go down to his office first thing in the morning and see if the janitor knows. I want her address. Be here not later than nine-thirty. We'll go and see her before we go to the office."

"Yes, boss," Chuck said dutifully. "I'll fix it. Anything else I can do?"

English gave him a quick smile.

"No. Go to bed and don't be late tomorrow."

He walked across to the entrance of the building, pushed against the revolving doors, nodded to the night porter who snapped to attention when he caught sight of him, and walked over to the elevator.

He thumbed a button, and leaned against the wall while the self-service elevator bore him swiftly and smoothly up fifteen floors to the penthouse apartment he had rented for Julie.

He walked down the walnut paneled corridor and paused outside the apartment. As he groped for his keys, his eyes shifted to the card in a chromium frame that was screwed on the door. It bore the single line of neat print: *Miss Julie Clair*.

He pushed the key into the lock, opened the door, and stepped into a small, lighted lobby. As he threw his hat and coat on a chair, the door opposite him opened and a girl stood framed in the doorway. She was tall and broad shouldered, with narrow hips and long legs. Her copper-colored hair was silky and dressed high on top of her small head. Her big almond-shaped eyes Were sea-green and glitteringly alive. She

was wearing olive green lounging pajamas with red piping, and her small feet were incased in high heeled red slippers.

Looking at her, English thought how very different she was from Corinne. How much more beautiful, and how much more character she showed in her face, which he considered to be more pleasing to his eyes than any other woman's he had met. Her make-up, even at this late hour, he thought, was a masterpiece of understatement. He knew she wore make-up, but he couldn't see where it began or left off.

"You're late, Nick," she said, smiling at him. "I was beginning to wonder if you were coming."

"Sorry, Julie," he returned, "but I've been held up."

He went over to her, put his hands on her hips and kissed her cheek.

"So Joey won his fight," she said, looking up at him. "You must be very pleased."

"Don't say you listened to the radio?" he said, leading her into the well appointed living room. A big fire burned brightly, and the shaded lamps made the atmosphere at once intimate and cosy.

"No, but I heard it on the news."

"You and Harry are a pair," he said, sinking into a big over-stuffed armchair and pulling her down on his knees. She curled up on his lap, slipping her arm around his neck, and resting her face against his cheek. "Believe it or not, although he handled most of the arrangements and worked like a dog for weeks, he stayed away from file fight. He's as squeamish as you are."

"I think fighting is a dirty business," she returned with a grimace. "I don't blame Harry for not going."

He stared at the bright flames and his hand stroked her silk clad thigh.

"Maybe it is, but there's a lot of money in it. Was the show all right?"

She shrugged. "I suppose so. They seemed to like it. I wasn't singing particularly well, but no one seemed to notice. Tell me about the fight, Nick."

"There's something else I have to tell you. Do you remember Roy?"

He felt her stiffen.

"Yes, of course. Why do you ask?"

"The fool shot himself tonight."

She half sat up, but he pulled her down against him again.

"Don't move, Julie."

"Is he dead?" she asked, her fingers gripping his arm.

"Yes, he's dead. That was one job he did manage to do efficiently."

She shivered.

"Don't talk like that, Nick. It's terrible. When did it happen?"

"About half past nine."

"But why did he . . . ?"

"Yeah, that puzzles me. Do you mind if I walk up and down? You're taking my mind off business." He lifted her, and got up, then set her gently in the chair, and moved over to the fireplace. "Why, Julie, you look pale."

"I suppose it's the shock. I wasn't expecting to hear anything like this. I don't know if you are upset, Nick, but if you are, I'm sorry."

"I'm not upset," English said, taking out his cigar case. "Maybe it was a shock, but I can't say I'm particularly sorry. Roy's been a damned nuisance ever since he was born. My old man and he were a pair. But I can't understand Roy's shooting himself. Morilli says he was short of money and was trying to raise the cash by threatening two or three of his old clients. He was going to lose his license. I would be willing to bet that Roy wouldn't have killed himself because of that. I shouldn't have believed that he would have had the nerve to kill himself no matter how bad a jam he was in. It's damned odd. Morilli says he's satisfied, but I still don't believe it"

Julie looked up quickly.

"But surely, Nick, if the police say so. . . ."

"Yeah, I know, but it foxes me. Why didn't he come to me if he was so hard up? Maybe I did throw him out last time, but that has never stopped him before. I've thrown him out lots of times and he's always come back."

"Perhaps he was too proud," Julie said quietly.

"Proud? Roy? Sweetheart, you can't have known Roy. He had a hide like an elephant. He'd take any insult so long as he got money out of me." English lit his cigar and began to move slowly about the room. "Why did the business fold up like that? When he got me to buy it for him, I took the trouble to investigate it pretty thoroughly. It was in the black then. It was an old established business. He couldn't have wrecked it so soon, unless he did it deliberately." He made an impatient gesture. "I was a fool to have had anything to do with it. I might have known he wouldn't have worked at it."

Julie watched him pace the floor.

"I've sent Lois to check up at his office," English went on. "She has a nose for that kind of thing."

"You sent Lois there tonight?" Julie said sharply.

"I phoned her on my way up here. I wanted her to have a look at the place before Corinne takes it into her head to go up there."

"You mean Lois is there now?"

English paused and looked at her, surprised at the sharpness of her tone.

"Yes, Harry's with her. She doesn't mind how late she works."

"Well, after all, it's nearly half past one. Couldn't it have waited until tomorrow?"

"Corinne might go up there," English said, frowning. He didn't like his orders questioned. "I want to know what Roy had been up to."

"I think she must be in love with you," Julie said, moving so that her back was turned to him.

"In love with me?" English said, startled. "Who? Corinne?"

"Lois. She acts as if she were your slave. No other girl would tolerate working for you, Nick."

English laughed.

"Nonsense. I pay her well. Besides, she isn't the kind of girl to fall in love with anyone."

"There's never been a girl who wouldn't fall in love if she's given a chance," Julie said quietly. "I should have thought that you would have had more insight, Nick, than to say a thing like that"

"Never mind Lois," English said a little impatiently. "We were talking about Roy. I went to see Corinne tonight."

"That was nice of you. I've never seen her. What's she like, Nick?"

"Blonde, plump and dumb-looking," English said, coming to sit on the arm of her armchair. "She told me that I was responsible for Roy's death and threw me out of the house."

"Nick!" Julie looked quickly at him, but was reassured by his smile.

"I guess she was hysterical, but to be on the safe side I got Sam Crail out of bed and sent him down to talk to her. I've got to be careful there isn't a stink about this business, Julie. I have a big deal cooking at the moment." His brown hand slid over her shoulder and his fingers gently stroked her throat. "In a few weeks, the Senator is going to break the news that I'm the man behind the new hospital. The committee knows, of course, but the press hasn't got it yet. The idea is to name the hospital after me."

"Name it after you?" Julie repeated blankly. "But why, for goodness sake?"

English grinned a little sheepishly.

"Sounds crazy, doesn't it. But I want it, Julie. I want it more than anything I've ever wanted." He got up and began to pace up and down. "I've made a fair success of my life, Julie. I started from scratch, and now I'm as good as the next man as regards money, but money isn't everything. If I drop dead this moment, no one would remember me in a week's time. It's the name people leave after them that counts. If the hospital were named after me—well, I guess I wouldn't be forgotten quite so easily. And then there's another thing— more important. I promised my mother I'd make a name for myself, and she believed me. She didn't live long enough to know that I had started on the way up. When she died, I was still fooling around with that compass and getting nowhere, but I told her that it was going to be a success, and I told her I was going way ahead, and she believed me. She would have got a big bang out of knowing the hospital is going to be named after me, and I'm soft in the head enough to think she'll still get a big bang out of it."

Julie listened in hypnotized silence. She had never had any idea that English could think and talk like this. She put her hand on his arm.

"If that's what you want, Nick, I want it, too."

"I guess that's right," he said, suddenly thoughtful. "But this business of Roy's might slap a lid on it."

"But why?"

"Believe it or not, Julie, it took me a hell of a time to persuade the commission to let me finance the hospital. You wouldn't believe that, would you?"

"What commission?"

"The City Planning Commission," he said patiently. "It's unbelievable what a bunch of stuffed-shirts they are. Although I bet their private lives wouldn't stand investigating, on the surface they are about the finest collection of plaster saints you've ever set eyes on. They didn't approve of me. Two of them even said I was a gangster. The Senator had to talk pretty sharply to them to get them to accept my money. At the time, nothing was said about the hospital being named after me. If it turns out that Roy was in trouble, that he blackmailed his clients, the chances of my name being used are as good as a snowball in hell. Morilli knows that. The Police Commissioner knows it, too. They'll expect to be taken care of if this is hushed up. But Corinne's the difficulty. She may try to cut off her nose to spite my face. If she lets on that I wouldn't finance Roy, and Roy was forced to raise money by blackmail, I shall be ruled out." He tossed the cigar into the fire and went on in a hushed voice, "Why couldn't the louse have shot himself next month when this was in the bag?"

Julie stood up.

"Let's go to bed, Nick," she said and slipped her arm through his. "Don't let's think any more about it tonight."

He gave her bottom an affectionate little pat.

"You're full of good ideas, Julie," he said. "We'll go to bed."



V

At the back of a modest walk-up apartment house on East Tenth Street, a small, shrub-infested garden ran down an alley hedged in on either side by a six foot brick wall.

For two hours, a man had been waiting in the alley, his eyes fixed on a lighted window on the third floor of the building.

He was a man of middle height, with broad and powerful shoulders. He wore a wide-brimmed brown slouch hat pulled down over his eyes, and in the dim light of the moon, only his thin lipped mouth and square shaped chin could be seen. The rest of his face was hidden by the black shadow cast by the hat brim. He was expensively dressed. His brown lounge suit, his white silk shirt and polka-dot bow tie gave him the appearance of a well-to-do operator, and once when he lifted his arm to consult a gold strap watch, he showed two inches of white shirt cuff, and the tail of a white silk handkerchief he wore tucked up his sleeve.

While he waited in the alley, he remained motionless. He chewed a stick of gum, his jaws moving rhythmically and continuously. His two hour vigil was conducted with the patience of a cat waiting for a mouse to appear.

A few minutes after midnight, the light in the third floor window suddenly went out and completed the darkness of the rest of the apartment house.

The man in the brown suit remained motionless. He leaned his broad shoulders against the brick wall, his hands thrust into his trouser pockets while he waited another half hour. Then, consulting his watch, he reached down into the darkness and picked up a coil of thin cord that lay near his feet. A heavy rubber covered hook was fastened to one end of the cord.

He swung himself over the wall and walked silently and rapidly up the cinder path that led through the garden to the back of the building.

The man in the brown suit paused under the swing-up end of the fire escape that was some five feet above his outstretched hand. He uncoiled the cord and tossed the hook into the air. The hook caught in the iron work of the escape, and held. He gently tightened his grip on the cord, then pulled. The end of the escape came down slowly and silently, and bumped on the ground. He climbed the escape, two steps at a time, without hesitation and without looking back to see if anyone happened to be watching him. He reached the third floor window that he had been watching for the past two hours, and saw with satisfaction that the window was open a few inches at the top and bottom. He noticed also the curtains across the windows were drawn. He knelt down by the window, his ear to the gap between the window frame and the sill, and listened. He remained like that for several minutes, then he put his fingers under the window frame and gently exerted pressure. The window moved up, inch by inch, making no sound.

The curtains hung well clear of the window, and he slid into the room without disturbing them. He turned and began to close the window, again moving it inch by inch, and again in silence. When the window was as he had found it, he straightened, turned and parted the curtains a few inches. He looked into darkness. The over-sweet smell of face powder, stale perfume and cosmetics told him he had made no mistake as to the room. He listened, and after a moment or so, he heard quick light breathing not far from where he stood.

He took out a pencil-thin flashlight, and shielding the bulb with his fingers, he switched the fight on. He saw a bed, a chair on which were some clothes, and a night table by the bed on which stood a small shaded lamp, a book and a clock.

The back of the bed was to the window. He could see the outline of a figure under the blankets. Hanging on the bedpost was a silk dressing gown.

Careful to keep the shielded light of his torch away from the sleeper in the bed, the man in the brown suit reached forward and gently pulled the silk cord of the dressing gown through its loops until he had disengaged it. He tested its strength, and, then satisfied, reached forward and picked up the book that was lying on the night table.

With the dressing gown cord and the flashlight in his left hand and the book in his right, he stepped behind the curtains again. He turned off the flashlight and slipped it into his pocket, then still keeping behind the curtains and holding one of them aside with his left hand, he tossed the book high and wide into the air.

The book landed on the polished boards of the floor. Coming down flat side up, it made a loud slapping noise that was intensified by the silence that brooded over the whole apartment.

The man in the brown suit closed the curtains and waited, his jaws moving rhythmically as he chewed. He heard the bed creak, and then a girl's voice said sharply, "who's that?"

He waited, without moving, his breathing normal, his head a little on one side as he listened.

The bedside lamp went on, sending a soft glow of light through the curtains. He opened them slightly so that he could see into the room.

A dark, slim girl in blue nylon nightdress was sitting up in the bed. She was looking towards the door, her hands clutching the blankets, and he could hear her rapid breathing.

Silently, he took one end of the dressing gown cord in his right hand, and the other end in his left. He turned sideways so that he could push aside the curtains.with his shoulder. He watched her, waiting.

She saw the book on the floor, and she looked quickly at the night table, and then back to the book again. Then she did what he was hoping she would do. She threw back the blankets and swung her feet to the floor, her hand reaching out for her dressing gown. She stood up and began to slide her arms into the sleeves of the dressing gown, turning her back on the window as she did so.

The man pushed aside the curtains with his shoulder and stepped silently into the room. With a movement too quick to follow, he whipped the cord over the girl's head, twisting it around her throat. He drove his knees into the small of her back, sending her down on her hands and knees. He dropped on her, flattening her to the floor. The cord bit into her throat, turning her wild scream into a thin, almost inaudible cry. He knelt on her shoulders and his two hands tightened the cord.

He remained like that, chewing steadily, and watching the convulsive heaving of her body and the feeble movement of her hands clawing at the carpet. He was careful, and kept the cord just tight enough to stop blood flowing to her head and air getting to her lungs. He had no difficulty in holding her down, and he saw with detached interest her movements were becoming less convulsed until only her muscles twitched in a reflex of agony.

He remained kneeling on her, the cord tight, for three or four minutes, then when he saw that there was no longer any movement, he carefully took the cord from her throat and turned her over on her back.

He frowned when he saw that a trickle of blood had run down one nostril and had made a smear on the rug. He put his finger on her eyeball, and when there was no answering flicker, he stood up and dusted his trouser knees while he looked quickly around the room.

He went to the door opposite the bed, opened it and looked into a small bathroom. He noted with a nod of his head the sturdy hook screwed to the back of the door.

He spent the next ten minutes or so arranging the room. His movements were unhurried and unruffled. When he had finished what he was doing, he surveyed the scene with quick, bright eyes that missed no detail. Then he turned off the lamp and went to the window. He opened it, turned to adjust the curtains, stepped out onto the fire escape and pulled down the window, leaving it as he had found it. Then he went quickly and silently down the fire escape to the darkness of the garden.
