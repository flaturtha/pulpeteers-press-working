### Chapter 6

Lois Marshall leaned forward and impatiently snapped off the television set. She turned on the shaded lamp, and bent to poke the fire. Rain continued to patter against the window-panes. Restlessly, she glanced at the clock on the mantel. It was ten minutes after nine.

She had been thinking regretfully of English's suggestion that they should have dinner together on Saturday night. It was the first time he had asked her to go out with him, and she had been badly caught off balance. Her immediate reaction was to have accepted, then she realized that Julie would find out, and she would tell Harry Vince who would tell someone else, until it was all around the office that poor Lois had at last been taken out by the boss.

She was sure that most of the staff, including Harry, guessed she was in love with English. Blood rose to her face as she thought of the gossip that probably went on in the office about her. Well, she was in love with English! It was something she couldn't help.

She got up and fetched her work basket, and settled down before the fire again. She was essentially a domestic sort of person, and would nave preferred to run a home than work in an office; and the small pile of mending that she had saved for a rainy evening, had a soothing effect upon her.

She paused in her work to look around the sitting room, and it pleased her. It would have pleased her more if she didn't have to live in it alone. Again, she headed herself off from brooding, and to divert her thoughts, she leaned over to switch on the radio when the front door bell rang.

She frowned, her eyes going to the clock. It was now twenty-five minutes to ten. She hesitated, wondering whether to go to the door or not

The bell rang again—two sharp impatient rings.

She laid aside her mending and walked into the lobby. Quietly, she slipped on the chain, then keeping to one side, she opened the door a few inches.

"Who is it?" she asked, sharply.

"Can I come in, Lois?" English said.

She felt herself turn hot, then cold. Quickly, she controlled herself.

English stood just outside. His light gray overcoat glistened with dampness.

"I'm sorry to call so late, Lois," he said quietly. "Am I in the way?"

"Of course not. Come in," she said, a cold feeling around her heart at the sight of his white, drawn face.

He entered the living room, and stood looking around.

"What a nice room, Lois," he said. "I can see your hand in everything here."

"I—I'm glad you like it," she said, watching him. She had never felt so frightened before. She could tell by his expression that something bad had happened, and she knew that he would never have come to her apartment unless he had nowhere else to go.

"Can I have your coat, Mr. English?"

He smiled at her.

"Don't let's be formal tonight, Lois. Call me Nick, will you?" He pulled off his coat.

"I'll take it into the bathroom," she said. "Go over to the fire, Nick."

"That's better," he said.

When she returned, he was sitting before the fire, his hands out toward the blaze.

She went over to the sideboard, mixed a stiff highball and brought it to him.

He took it, and smiled up at her.

"You always know the right thing to do, don't you?"

She saw his eyes were frozen and hard.

"What's happened?" she asked, sharply, standing before him.

He gave her a sharp look, then reached out and patted her hand.

"Sorry, Lois," he said. "This is going to be a shock. Julie was murdered tonight. She and Harry. It all points to me."

"My God!" she said, then she pulled herself together. "What happened, Nick?"

"I was having a drink with Beaumont," English said, speaking rapidly. "Corinne came in. She was drunk. The bar was crowded—everyone, including Rees and Lola Vegas, heard what she said. She told me that Julie and Harry had been lovers for months—that Julie was with Harry in his apartment. I got rid of Corinne and took a taxi to Harry's place. The door was locked. I knocked and called out. Julie answered. She sounded terrified. She said she was going to be shot. She screamed for me to save her. It took me some moments to get the door open. I heard a shot; then another. I smashed the lock. Julie was lying on the floor. She was dying." He paused and took a long drink, set down the glass and rubbed his eyes. "She died hard, Lois. She didn't deserve a death like that. She said it was Sherman who shot her. That he had gone out through the bedroom window. I held her in my arms until she died." He groped in his pocket, vaguely. Lois reached out, took a cigarette from a box, lit it and gave it to him. "Thanks," he said, not looking at her. "I hope I made things a bit easier for her," he went on, half to himself. "She was frightened I'd be angry with her. She didn't seem to realize she was dying. She kept asking me to forgive her."

Lois suppressed a shudder.

"What happened, then," she asked, sharply.

He looked up and frowned.

"I went into the bedroom. Harry was on the floor. He was dead too. I pulled aside the curtain, but I couldn't see anyone in the river. It was dark and raining hard. I went to the telephone to call the police, then I saw the gun on the floor. It looked familiar. I picked it up. That was stupid of me. It was my gun. It's been in my desk for years. Then I realized what a frame he had built for me. A dozen witnesses will testify that Corinne had told me that Julie and Harry were lovers. The taxi-driver will testify he took me to Harry's apartment. The gun that killed them is my gun. They were shot a minute or so after I had arrived. The motive, the time, the weapon—what more can the D.A. want?"

"If Sherman killed them," Lois said quietly, "Leon will know about it. He was following Sherman, wasn't he?"

English stiffened, and then drove his right fist into the palm of his left hand.

"Why, damn it! I'd forgotten that. Of course, Ed wouldn't have let him out of his sight. That's it! I believe we've got him, Lois! Try and get Ed. Call my apartment first."

As Lois began to dial the number she said, "You didn't call the police?"

"No. I walked out. I wanted to get my bearings."

"You left the gun?"

"Yes."

Leon's voice came over the line.

"Hello?"

"This is Lois Marshall," Lois said. "Did you keep contact with Sherman tonight."

"He never left his apartment," Leon returned. "What's the idea? Why are you calling?"

"He says Sherman didn't leave his apartment," Lois said, turning cold as she looked at English. "Are you sure he didn't leave?" she went on to Leon.

"Of course, I'm sure! Both exits are guarded. There's no other way out. Besides, I've been along to his apartment every half hour. The radio's playing non-stop, and the lights are on."

"He's certain Sherman didn't leave his apartment," she said, turning to English.

'TeJl him to come here at once!"

"Will you come to my apartment?" she said. "It's urgent."

"I'm waiting for English," Leon said, impatiently. "What's the trouble?"

"I can't talk on the telephone," she said. "You must come right away."

"Well, all right," Leon growled, and hung up.

"Shall I get Mr. Crail?" Lois asked, as she broke the connection.

English nodded.

"Yes. But not that he can do anything."

While she was dialing Crail's home number, English began to pace slowly.

"Julie couldn't have been mistaken," he said savagely. "She described Sherman. Damn Leon I"

Lois spoke over the telephone, and then hung up.

"He's coming," she said, and went unsteadily to a chair and sat down. "You shouldn't have left the gun, Nick."

"The gun doesn't matter," English said, continuing to pace up and down. "It would ruin my case if I hid it. I've got to stick to the truth, Lois, if I'm to beat the rap. I've got to prove that Sherman stole my gun."

"How did Corinne know about Julie?" Lois asked.

English frowned.

"I don't know, unless . . ." He stopped to think. "Yes! That's it! Of course! Roy was blackmailing Julie. He must have found out what was going on between Julie and Harry. He must have told Corinne."

"Don't you think it's more likely that Sherman told Corinne?" Lois said. "Don't you think they're working together?"

"What makes you say that?" English asked, staring at her.

"How could Sherman know for certain that you would go to Harry's apartment?" Lois said. "How could he be sure you'd arrive while he was there unless the whole thing had been planned? Of course, Corinne was in on this!"

"I believe you're right," English said. "If we could get her to talk . . . ! I'll tell Ed to pick her up as soon as he gets here. If we can get her to talk, we're half way to proving Sherman did it."

"I'll get her," Lois said, jumping to her feet. "You have to talk to Leon. It'll only waste time for him to go. I'll be back by the time you have finished talking to him."

"She may not come," English said, uneasily.

"Oh, yes, she will," Lois said, her face hardening. "I promise you that." She went quickly into her bedroom to change. She came out a few minutes later, struggling into a coat. "Don't move from here, Nick," she said. "I won't be half an hour."

"I don't like your going," English said. "It's raining like hell."

Lois tried to smile.

"A little rain won't hurt me. I won't be long."

He reached out and took her hand.

"I'm damned if I know what I should do without you," he said.

She pulled her hand away and ran to the door, fighting back her tears.

"I won't be long," she repeated, huskily.



II

Roger Sherman's fingers hooked over the rungs of the iron ladder. Slowly, he hauled himself up, paused to look up and down the deserted waterfront, and then climbed on to the jetty.

Moving quickly and silently, he came to a dark hut that stood at the shore end of the jetty, pushed open the door and entered a room half full of empty crates and barrels.

He dipped into one of the crates and pulled out a suitcase he had left there the previous evening.

He stripped off his wet clothes and rubbed himself down with a towel. Then he took from the case, a complete change of clothing, dressed quickly and packed bis wet clothes in the case.

He left the hut, looked to right and left, then dropped the case into the river. It sank with scarcely a ripple. Again, he looked to right and left, and satisfied he had the waterfront to himself, he walked quickly off the jetty, up an alley until he reached Tenth Street.

He headed for the subway, and he took an uptown train and got off at 110th Street. He walked the length of the street before hailing a taxi.

"Mason Street," he said, as he climbed in.

He sat in the corner of the taxi, chewing, his eyes thoughtful, every now and then glancing through the rear window.

He left the taxi at the corner of Mason Street, turned left at Lawrence Boulevard and, still keeping in the shadows, walked quickly to the door of Corrine English's bungalow.

He pressed the bell, grimacing as he heard the chimes on the other side of the door. He waited several minutes, frowning, then he pressed the bell again.

A light sprang up in the lobby and the front door opened. Corinne stood before him, holding on to the door. She smelled of liquor.

"Who is it?" she said, peering at him.

"Have you forgotten me so soon, Corinne?" he said softly.

He saw her stiffen, and her hand went to the door handle. He put his foot against the door to stop her slamming it in his face.

"What do you want?" she said, sullenly.

His amber-colored eyes searched her face.

"I was expecting you to call me, but you didn't I think Td better come in."

"I don't want you to come in," she said, trying to close the door. "I don't want to see you any more."

He moved forward, forcing her back into the hallway.

"I'm getting wet," he said, with deceptive mildness. "Did you see English?"

She turned and went unsteadily into the living room. She lurched as she reached the fireplace. On the mantel, was a bottle and a glass half full of brandy.

He dropped his wet coat and hat on the floor of the hall, then he turned and quietly pushed the bolt on the front door.

He walked into the living room, smiling.

"You haven't answered my question. Did you see English?"

"I saw him," she said, and dropped on to the couch, holding the glass of brandy, slopping some of it as she sat down.

"You don't sound very happy," he said. "Wasn't our idea a success?"

"It was your idea, not mine," Corinne said, "and it was a lousy idea. He didn't give a damn."

Sherman went over to the liquor cabinet, selected a brandy glass and came over to the fire. He half filled the glass, sniffed at it, and cocked his head on one side.

"It was a very good idea," Sherman said. He drank some of the brandy and put down the glass. "Tell me what happened."

"I'm not going to. It was horrible!" Corinne said, and began to cry. "I wish I hadn't done it. They—they laughed at me."

"Who laughed at you?" Sherman asked, his eyes intent.

"I don't know. They all laughed at me. He was so damned smooth about it. They could see I was drunk."

"Who are they'?"

"The people in the bar, of course." Corinne's voice went shrill. "Who else do you think?"

"You told English they were lovers then?" Sherman asked, watching her.

"Of course, I did! That's what you told me to do, and he didn't give a damn. He said it wasn't my business, nor his," Corinne said, dabbing her eyes. "He sent me home with some smooth punk from the club. That's how your lousy idea worked out."

Sherman nodded. He had learned what he wanted to know —that there had been witnesses to Corinne's outburst.

"You might be interested to know," he said, "that after you had left the club, English went to Vince's apartment. He found Julie and Vince there. He shot Vince, and then Julie. The police are already on the scene, and I imagine English is under arrest by now for murder."

Corinne stared at him, her plump, baby face seemed to shrink, and her big, blue eyes looked enormous.

"He shot them?" she said, huskily.

"That's what he did," Sherman said, taking out a package of chewing gum and stripping off the paper. "Do you think my idea is so lousy now?"

"You mean—he killed them?" Corinne's voice went up a note.

"Yes, he killed them."

"I don't believe it!"

"You will when you see tomorrow's newspapers."

"How do you know? You talk as if you were there!"

"I wasn't very far away," Sherman said, smiling. "I, more or less, saw what happened."

"I didn't want them to be killed!" Corinne said, starting to her feet. "I—I only wanted to hurt him!"

"You have hurt him," Sherman said. "You've done more than that—you've ruined him! He'll go to the chair."

"But I don't want to ruin him!" Corinne wailed. "He was kind to me."

"How touching," Sherman said, with a little sneer. "In spite of the fact that he didn't hesitate to steal twenty thousand dollars from you?"

Corinne stared at him, her fists clenched.

"I don't believe Roy ever had all that money," she said. "I was a fool to have listened to you. You're responsible for this. It was your idea. You wanted to get even with him, and you used me to do it!"

"What a clever girl you've suddenly become," Sherman said, smiling. "Suppose that was so, what are you going to do about it?"

"I'm going to the police!" Corinne said. "It was a terrible thing to do."

"Don't be stupid, Corinne," Sherman said. "There's nothing you can do now except keep your mouth shut."

"We'll see about that!" Corinne said, angrily. "I'll talk to Lieutenant Morilli. I'll tell him it was your idea."

Sherman nodded as if he expected her to say that. He began to wander around the room, his hands in his pockets, his jaws moving, his eyes expressionless.

"Yes, I suppose you will," he said, pausing by the window. He reached out and took hold of a red silk curtain cord, hanging by a hook. His fingers absently tested its strength.

'This is an extraordinary thing," he said, "I've been looking for a curtain cord like this for weeks. You wouldn't believe it, but I can't find this exact shade anywhere." He took the cord,off the hook and moved over to the lamp to examine it "Do you happen to remember where you bought it?"

"You're not going to put me off like that!" Corinne snapped. "You're trying to change the subject. I'm going to telephone Lieutenant Morilli right now!"

"I'm not trying to change the subject," Sherman said, mildly. The cord hung like a red snake in his fingers. "I do wish you could remember where you bought this."

"I don't remember," Corinne said, and picked up the telephone book.

"Well, if you can't remember, you can't—a pity!" Sherman said.

Corinne was bending over the telephone book she had placed on the table. Sherman moved behind her. He arranged the cord into a loop.

The sudden sound of chimes at the front door turned him into a motionless statue.

Corinne looked up, frowning. She saw Sherman's reflection in the mirror above the mantel. He was standing close behind her, his hands raised, the loop of cord hovering above her head.

She knew at once what he was about to do, and she stumbled aside, keeping her back turned to him.

"I'll answer it," she managed to get out, and before he could stop her, she ran unsteadily to the door, opened it and went into the hall.

She tried to open the front door, her knees buckling under her. Then she saw the bolt had been pushed home and she jerked it back.

A tall, dark girl in a soaked raincoat stood on the step.

"Mrs. English?"

Corinne nodded. Her breath whistled through her open mouth and she was trembling so violently that she could hardly stand.

"I'm Lois Marshall, Mr. English's secretary," Lois said. "May I come in?"

"Oh, yes," Corinne gasped. "Yes, come in."

Lois looked at her sharply as she stepped into the hallway.

"Is anything the matter? You look frightened."

"Frightened?" Corinne said huskily. "I'm terrified. There's a man in there . . ."

Sherman came to the living room door, a .38 Police Special in his hand. He pointed it at Lois, and smiled.

"Come in, Miss Marshall," he said quietly. "Unexpected, but nevertheless welcome."

Corinne's hands fluttered to her face.

"I—I think he was going to strangle me," she said, and slid to the floor in a faint.



III

English lifted bis hands.

"Well, there you are! That's the setup. How do you like it?"

Crail took out his handkerchief, and wiped his sweating face.

"This is bad, Nick," he said in a hard, tight voice.

"A master of the understatement," Leon said from his armchair. "The man says it's bad. Brother, it's a lot worse than bad—the lid's blown right off."

English said curtly, "You haven't been much help, Ed. I told you to watch that devil."

"Take it easy," Leon said. "We were watching-him. I hired two of Black's men, and they're good. We haven't let him out of our sight since noon. There are only two exits to Crown Court, as you know. I had them both covered. I remained in your apartment, and every half hour I went along to Sherman's apartment and listened outside the door. He was in there, playing his radio."

"But he shot Julie and Harry!"

"Sure she didn't make a mistake?"

"No, she described him. It was Sherman all right."

"He couldn't have left the building."

"Is he there now?" Crail put in.

"He should be. When Miss Marshall called me, I left Burt and Horwill watching the entrance and the rear exit. I guess he's there or they'll know about it,"

English went over to the telephone, dialed Sherman's number and listened to the steady ringing. After a while, he hung up.

"He doesn't answer."

"That doesn't prove he isn't there," Leon said.

"There's only one thing you can do," Crail said. "Come down with me to headquarters and let me give the Commissioner the whole story."

English smiled sarcastically.

"How he'll love it. How Rees will love it. How the Mayor will love it. Do you think any of them will believe me? Not a chance in hell!"

"He's right," Leon said.

"He's got to give himself up!" Crail said violently. He turned to English. "You can see that, can't you? It's your only hope of beating this rap."

English shook his head.

"Take it easy, Sam. I know your advice is sound, but you're forgetting what I'm up against. I've got too many enemies. Rees is only waiting for a chance to fix me, and I've given it to him. With me in jail, the D.A. knows that Beaumont will fold up. It can't be done. No matter how smart you are, you can't beat the combination. It's too strong. There's only one way of beating this rap. We've got to find Sherman, and we've got to crack him so that he'll come clean. There's no other way."

Crail stood looking at English for a long moment, then he lifted his fat shoulders.

"All right. But don't forget I warned you. I'll do what I can when it comes to the trail, but you're tying my hands."

He picked up his hat and coat. "You know where to find me, Nick, when you want me. Good luck to you!"

English came over and shook hands.

'Take it easy, Sam. I've handled my affairs all right up to now, and I think this is the way to play it."

When Crail had gone, English poured a little whiskey into a glass and drank it His face was hard and pale.

"He's right, you know, Ed," he said, beginning to pace up and down. "If we can't find Sherman we're sunk."

"We'll find him and we'll make him talk."

English glanced at the clock on the mantel.

"I wish Lois would hurry up," he said, sitting down. "She's been gone three quarters of an hour."

Leon stretched his long legs toward the fire.

"Gone where?"

"To get Corinne. I didn't tell Sam because he would have started fussing about the legal end, but Corinne must have been working with Sherman. If I could talk to her, I might be able to get her to admit it. She could be a big help in upsetting Sherman. Once we've got Sherman in the box, Corinne's evidence might unseat him."

"Let's hope Sherman hasn't thought of that angle," Leon said lazily, reaching for a pack of cigarettes.

English stiffened and half sat up.

"What did you say?"

Leon glanced up, surprised at the sharpness of English's tone.

"I said I hoped that Sherman doesn't realize Corinne would be used as a witness against him. Might be bad for her if he did."

English got to his feet The look in his eyes brought Leon out of his chair.

"What's biting you?" Leon demanded.

"I must be out of my mind!" English said. "I let that girl go ...."

"So what? What are you worrying about?"

"Suppose Sherman's there. Suppose she walks into him. I shouldn't have let her go. That fellow is a homicidal maniac I'm going to see what's happened to her."

"Now, wait a minute," Leon said, his voice sharpening. "You're staying right here. How far do you think you'll get? I'll go. The chances are she'll be here before I get back."

"I'm going with you!"

"Then if she came back with Corinne, she'd find no one here. Use your head, Nick!"

English hesitated, then shrugged.

"I guess that's right. Well, get going, Ed. For God's sake, get there fast."

"Leave it to me," Leon said. He snatched up his coat and hat and plunged out of the room.

He reached Lawrence Boulevard after five minutes' furious driving, his eyes alert for any sign of trouble, but the long street was rainswept and deserted. He pulled up some yards from Corinne's bungalow, and got out of the car.

He stood for a moment in the rain, to look up and down the street, then he walked toward the bungalow, noting that there was a light on in the living room.

He went up the path and rang the bell. He waited several minutes, then rang again. No one answered the door, nor did he hear any sound of movement in the bungalow.

Cautiously, he turned the handle and pushed, but the door was locked. He rang again, then after waiting a minute, he stepped out of the shelter of the porch, on to the flower bed. ' to see if he could look into the living room, but the curtains were too closely drawn, and he could see nothing.

He walked across the wet grass to the path leading to the back of the bungalow. When he turned the handle of the door, he found it unlocked.

He pushed it open and stepped into a small kitchen. His feet kicked against something that clanked noisily, and he cursed under his bream. From his pocket, he took a small flashlight and turned it on.

He opened the kitchen door, glanced into the dark hall, listened, then moved forward, making no sound.

The living room was empty. An overturned bottle had emptied its content on the rug before the dying fire. A broken glass lay on the hearth.

He moved into the room, frowning, not liking the spilled whiskey, feeling that here might be a bit of violence. He moved around the room, his eyes missing nothing, not knowing what he was looking for but hoping to find something that would explain why the light was on and the room empty.

On the couch, pushed half out of sight, he saw something white, and he fished it out from under the cushion. It was a woman's handkerchief, embroidered in the corner were the initials "L.M."

He shook his head. Lois must have persuaded Corinne to leave with her, he thought, and they had forgotten to turn off the light

He looked around for the telephone, to call English, to ask him if Lois had returned, when his eyes encountered the overturned bottle again. He frowned. Had Corinne been tight, he wondered? Had Lois' ring startled her so that she had upset the bottle? It seemed unlikely, and he went out into the hallway.

Facing him was a door. He turned the handle and pushed it open. The room was in darkness, and he groped for the light switch and turned it on.

The bedroom was as untidy as the kitchen. In the middle of the floor was a rose colored silk wrap. Stockings, underclothes and a fur coat lay on the bed. The dressing table was a smother of face powder, and the mirror above it hadn't been dusted for days. A bottle of hand lotion had been knocked over, and its white, creamy contents had made a messy puddle on the floor.

Leon grimaced, shrugging, and as he was about to turn off the light, he paused, his eyes narrowing.

A door opposite him attracted his attention. It was open a few inches, and fastened to one of the dress hooks screwed to the door was a red silk cord that ran over the top of the door and disappeared down the other side.

The cord looked taut! Too taut, as if it were supporting a heavy weight.

Leon quickly crossed the room, pushed against the door which opened sluggishly. Something heavy bumped against the other side as he pushed.

He stepped into a blue and white bathroom, his heart skipping a beat.

He was half prepared for what he saw, but, even at that, his stomach gave a little heave as he looked at Corinne English's dead face.

She hung grotesquely against the door, her knees drawn up in agony, her baby face puffed and swollen, her tongue pushing out between her small, white teeth. The red silk cord had bitten deeply into her neck, and her hands were rigid claws as if she had been frantically trying to push someone away in the last moments of her life.

Leon touched one of her hands. It was still warm, and he stepped away, his face hard and white.

For a long moment he stood thinking, his eyes averted from the hanging body, then he moved around the door into the bedroom, walked quickly into the hall and into the living room.

He was thinking now of Lois. Had she come to the bungalow and found Corinne, or had she arrived before Corinne had been murdered?

Leon felt sweat beading his face. If he told English what had happened to Corinne, English would come out of cover. There'd be no controlling him, especially if he thought Lois

was in Sherman's hands.

Uneasily, Leon wiped his face with his handkerchief. It did look as if Lois were in Sherman's hands. He stood, hesitating, trying to make up his mind what to do. He decided he had to find out if Lois had returned to her apartment. This might be a false alarm. She might be there, and safe.

He went over to the telephone, thumbed through the telephone directory until he found Lois' number, and then dialed.

He waited impatiently, listening to the burr-burr-burr on the line.

There was a sudden click and a man's voice said, "Who is that?"

Leon stiffened, sure it wasn't English who was speaking.

"Is that Westside 57794?" he asked, cautiously.

"That's right. Who's calling?"

It wasn't English, Leon thought.

"I'd like to speak to Miss Marshall," he said.

"She's not here," the voice told him. "Who's that speaking?"

"Come to that," Leon said sharply, "Who are you?"

Leon felt a chill run down his spine. Morilli! Had English got away? He hurriedly dropped the receiver back on to its cradle.



IV

Nick English paced slowly up and down, his hands in his trousers pockets, his face set and anxious. He kept looking at the clock on the mantel. It was now a little more than an hour since Lois had left the apartment—a little less than a quarter of an hour since Leon had gone to look for her.

English calculated it would take Leon twenty minutes to get to Lawrence Boulevard. Even if he didn't find Lois there, it didn't necessarily mean she was in danger. She might have left the bungalow before Leon arrived.

What a thoughtless fool he had been to let her go! He should have realized that Corinne was dangerous to Sherman.

With a sense of shock he realized that Lois meant something to him. Only now that Julie was dead, was he able to judge Lois' worth. Julie had been a physical attraction—a doll to dress, to amuse, to sleep with. Whereas Lois had worked by his side for five hard years, and he knew that it had been largely due to her help and confidence in him, that he had succeeded.

Impatiently, he went to the window, pulled aside the shade and looked down into the wet street below.

He stood watching the empty street for several minutes, hoping to catch a glimpse of Lois. Then as he was about to drop the shade, he saw the headlights of a fast moving car coming down the street, and he stiffened to attention, wondering if it were Lois returning.

The car swung to the curb and pulled up outside the walk-up. English saw the red spotlight on the hood and recognized the black-and-white check pattern of the body. He quickly dropped the shade.

The police!

Did they know he was here, or were they checking on the off-chance of finding? He moved quickly across the room, snatched up his hat and coat, and went into the hall.

He had no idea if there were a rear exit to this building. Even if he found it, the chances were that he'd walk into one of them.

He hesitated for a moment, then tossed his hat and coat on to a chair and returned to the sitting room.

If he was cornered, then he was cornered. He'd be damned if he would run like some cheap punk.

He stood before the fireplace, his hands behind his back, his face hard and set, and waited.

Minutes ticked by, and just when he was beginning to think that it was a false alarm, the front door bell rang sharply.

He stepped quickly to the telephone, took up the receiver and dialed Sam Crail's home number. His call was answered almost immediately by Crail, himself.

"Sam? This is Nick," English said, speaking quietly and rapidly. "You win. They're ringing the bell now."

"Say nothing," Crail snapped. "I'll be at headquarters before you get there. Leave it to me, Nick. Just say nothing. Where's Leon?"

"He's not here. Keep in touch with him, Sam. I've got to rely on you two."

"You can rely on us," Crail said. "Just keep your mouth shut and leave everything to me."

"Very comforting advice," English said drily. He heard the front door bell ring again. 'They're getting impatient. See you at headquarters," and he hung up.

He walked across the room, into the hall, and opened the door.

Morilli stood in the passage, one hand in his coat pocket. His lean, hatchet face looked pallid in the soft light, and his eyes were wary.

"Hello, Lieutenant," English said calmly. 'This is unexpected. What do you want?"

"Can I come in, Mr. English?" Morilli said.

"You alone?"

"I have company, but he's downstairs."

English nodded, and stood aside.

"Come on in."

Morilli walked into the hall, shut the front door and waved English toward the living room. English went ahead, crossed over to the fireplace, and turned to face Morilli.

Morilli looked suspiciously around the living room as he came in.

"There's no one here but me," English said. "Miss Marshall is out."

Morilli nodded, ran a thumbnail along his black moustache.

"I don't have to tell you why I'm here, Mr. English?"

English smiled.

"I gave up making guesses long ago," he said. "Suppose you tell me."

"You're to be charged with the murder of Julie Clair and Harry Vince," Morilli said, and his small, hard eyes shifted away from English.

"I'm surprised you've taken the job on, Lieutenant," English said. "I had an idea you gave service."

"I'm still giving service," Morilli returned. "That's why I'm here. I thought it would be safer for you if I made the arrest."

English raised his eyebrows.

"What does that mean?"

"You wouldn't be the first guy who's been shot in the back while resisting arrest," Morilli said. "There are a lot of high-ups who would be happy to be rid of you, Mr. English."

"Including the Commissioner?"

Morilli lifted his shoulders.

"I don't know, but I thought I'd be doing you a favor to handle this myself. This is a bad business, Mr. English. The D.A. thinks he has a watertight case."

English didn't say anything.

"You went to Vince's apartment, didn't you?" Morilli asked, his eyes probing.

"Crail told me not to talk," English said, lightly. 'Tve paid him a lot of money in the past so I'd better take his advice, now, Lieutenant."

"I guess that's right." Morilli said, and again stroked his moustache. "This rap will want a lot of beating."

English said, "Well, I mustn't keep you. Shall we go?"

As he moved toward the door, the telephone bell began to ring. He made a movement to answer it, but Morilli got there first.

English watched him, his eyes narrowed, his face set.

"Who's that?" Morilli said sharply. He listened, then said, "That's right. Who's calling?" He listened again, said "She's not here. Who's that speaking?"

English felt a cold chill run down his spine. It must be Ed who was asking for Lois. That meant he hadn't found her at Corinne's place.

"This is Lieutenant Morilli of the Homicide Bureau," Morilli snapped. "Quit stalling! Who are you?"

He cursed softly as the connection was broken, then he rattled the telephone plunger.

"Operator! This is Lieutenant Morilli, police headquarters. Where was that call made from?" He waited, then said, "Thanks. Put me through to headquarters, will you?" Again he waited, then said, "Barker? Morilli. Get a car over to 25 Lawrence Boulevard as fast as you can. There may be trouble there. Call me back as soon as you've had a report. I'm at Westside 57794."

English said, "That's my sister-in-law's place. What makes you think she's in trouble?"

Morilli gave him a cold, searching stare.

"Why didn't she answer the phone?" he demanded. "What was Leon doing there?"

"Leon?" English frowned. "Was he there?"

"I recognized his voice. I'm not all that dumb. Your sister-in-law is an important witness against you. The Comissioner wouldn't want anything to happen to her."

"Why should anything happen to her? Do we go or do we wait?"

"We wait," Morilli said, curtly, and began to move about the room, his eyes shifting to English continuously.

English sat down. His mouth was dry, and his heart beat unevenly. At least, now, he would know if there were something wrong at Corinne's place.

They waited while the hands of the clock crawled forward. Then the telephone rang, and Morilli scooped up the receiver.

"Yeah, Morilli speaking," he said. "What's that? Well, for crying out loud! Did they pick up Leon? Then send a call out for him. He was there not more then ten minutes ago. I want that guy. Yeah, I'll get over as soon as I can. Let Jamie-son handle it. Okay, be seeing you," and he slammed down the receiver.

English braced himself. He could tell by Morilli's expression that something bad had happened.

"Your sister-in-law was found hanged," Morilli said, his face white with fury. "How do you like that? You wouldn't have sent Leon down to shut her mouth, would you?"

"Dead?" English said, getting to his feet.

"Murdered! Hanged like Mary Savitt was hanged, only this time I'm not covering up for you," Morilli snarled..

Where was Lois? English thought, cold fear gripping at his heart. At all costs, he must find her.

"Would ten thousand buy me anything, Lieutenant?" he said, quietly, his eyes on Morilli's face.

"Quit kidding yourself," Morilli said viciously. "Your spending days are over. By tomorrow morning, the banks won't touch your checks. The Commissioner didn't forget that money is your power. All that's been taken care of. You re washed up. Don't try to wave your dough in my face. You haven't any. Come on, let's get out of here."

"I have money in the office," English said. "Don't be a fool. No one knows I'm here. Give me an out and make yourself six thousand."

Morilli showed his teeth in a grin.

"There's an officer sitting by your safe right at this moment. The Commissioner has thought of all the angles. You haven't any money. Come on!"

English shifted his shoulders. He was determined now he wasn't going to be locked in a cell while Lois was in danger. Casually, he moved toward Morilli, but something about his attitude warned Morilli who jerked out a gun.

"Take it easy," he said, evenly.

English smiled.

"Don't be dramatic, Lieutenant. Even if I did get away, where would I go?"

"Get going, and watch your step," Morilli said.

They went out of the apartment and down the four flights of stairs to the lobby.

At the bottom of the stairs, a thickset, red-faced detective leaned against the wall, chewing on a toothpick. He eyed English over, then glanced at Morilli.

"Let's get going," Morilli said, impatiently. "We've got a murder on our hands after we've turned this guy in."

The red-faced detective went down the steps to the waiting car.

English followed him, with Morilli at his heels. As English paused by the car and set himself, Morilli rammed his gun into his side.

"Start something, and I'll spread your guts on the sidewalk!" he said, viciously.

"For a blackmailer, you show very little respect for your benefactor," English said and smiled.

"Get in!" Morilli snapped. "And watch it!"

English climbed into the car, and Morilli followed him.

"Okay, Nankin," Morilli said to the detective. "Let's have some speed."

The car shot away from the curb and headed downtown, keeping to the side streets.

English sat motionless, feeling Morilli's gun against his side, and inwardly seething. He realized his chances of escaping were slight, and his hopes would now have to rest on Ed.

As they swept over the Blackstone Bridge, English said sharply, "This isn't the way to headquarters. What's the idea?"

Morilli smiled.

"I have a call to make first Relax. You're in no hurry to get anywhere."

"But he'll get there just the same," Nankin said, and laughed.

English relaxed back into the corner of the seat. He should have guessed that Morilli wouldn't have risked bringing him in alive. He knew too much for Morilli's safety. There was the five thousand dollars he had given Morilli. Maybe there was no proof that Morilli had received the money, but an accusation like that would lead to an investigation, and Morilli's bank manager might have a story to tell.

Besides, Morilli wouldn't only be covering himself, he would also be doing a service to a number of high-ups by getting rid of English. It would be a neat way of closing an embarrassing case.

English's eyes went to Morilli's gun. It was pointing at him, and Morilli's finger was on the trigger. He decided that it would be useless to start anything in the car. He would have to make his break when they got out.

The waterfront was deserted. A good place to kill someone, English thought. A shot, and then the river.

Morilli said sharply, "Okay, Nankin." His voice sounded tight and metallic.

Nankin slowed down, steered the car into the shadows of a warehouse, and pulled up. "Get out," Morilli said to English.

English looked at him.

"What's this—an unofficial execution?"

Morilli rammed the gun into his side.

"Get out. I don't want you to bleed in this car."

As English opened the door, Nankin got out hurriedly and ran around the front of the car, pulling a gun as he did so. He covered English until Morilli got out

"Unwise to have a witness, Lieutenant," English said, calmly. "He'll blackmail you if you kill me."

Nankin laughed.

"Me and the Lieutenant work together, pal," he said. "Don't you bother your brains about us."

Morilli swung up his gun and pointed it at English.

"This is yours, English," he said. "I'm not taking a chance on you talking. Back up against that wall."

English braced himself. He was too far from the river to jump for it—too far from Morilli, to close with him. He knew he was within a heartbeat of death. He was surprised that he felt no fear—only an angry frustration that he now wouldn't be able to even things up with Sherman.

He stepped back.

"Drop those rods!" A voice barked from behind the car. "Quick, or I'll blast both of you to blazes!"

Nankin hurriedly dropped his gun. Morilli half turned, his lips coming off his teeth in a furious snarl.

A gun crashed, and he staggered, dropping his automatic and gripping his wrist, cursing.

Chuck Eagan came out from behind the car.

"Thought I'd better come along for the ride, boss," he said, cheerfully. "I never did trust this goddam flat-foot"

English stepped forward and picked up Morilli's gun. He kicked Nankin's gun across the waterfront into the river.

"Phew! You timed it a little close, Chuck," he said, with a wry smile.

"Better late than never," Chuck returned, grinning. "What do we do with these lice?"

"I want them out of the way for a few hours, Chuck," English said. "What do you suggest?"

"Easy," Chuck said, and stepping up to Nankin, he slammed him over the head with his gun butt.

Morilli backed away as Nankin fell face down.

English said, "Don't move. I'm tempted to make a hole in your hide!"

Morilli snarled at him.

"You'll be sorry for this."

Chuck hit him on the back of his skull, driving him to his knees. Then he hit him again, and Morilli spread out on the rain-soaked concrete.

"Stick with them, Chuck. Put them somewhere out of the way. I want a couple of hours to myself."

"Don't rush off alone," Chuck said uneasily.

"Stick with them," English said, curtly. "That's an order."

He walked over to the police car and slid under the wheel.

As he started the engine, he leaned out of the window.

"Thanks, Chuck, I'll remember this."

He reversed the car, and sent it shooting along the waterfront, heading uptown.



V

Lois opened her eyes, and blinked painfully up at an amber lamp that was screwed flush to the ceiling. The light sent sharp, stabbing pains through her head, and she shut her eyes, biting her hp to stop from crying out.

She lay still for several minutes. Her mind slowly came out of the fog of unconsciousness. Where was she? she wondered. She remembered seeing Corinne fall to the floor in a faint. She remembered bending over her, hearing a sudden swishing sound, feeling a shocking blow—then nothing.

She opened her eyes again, not looking at the light, and after a moment or so, the hot pricking in her eyes went away.

She was in what must be the cabin of a ship. It was a luxury cabin, paneled in walnut and furnished expensively, with taste. She was lying on a bed, and she looked hastily to see if she was still dressed. Someone had taken off her coat, hat and shoes, but otherwise she was still in the clothes in which she had left her apartment.

She slowly lifted her head, grimacing as a stab of pain drove into her temples.

"So you're all ready to join the party," a man's voice said near her, making her start. She looked quickly to her left.

A big man, with a thin white scar, running from his right ear to his mouth and with a cast in his left eye, sat in an armchair that was set against the cabin door. A cigarette hung from his thin lips, and he nursed a heavily bandaged wrist.

"That must have been quite a smack you walked into," he said, his eyes running over her. "You've been out for over an hour."

Her hand went automatically to her skirt and pulled it down as far as it would go, as she saw the expression in his eyes.

"Don't excite yourself," the man with the scar said, taking out a pack of cigarettes. "That's not the first pair of gams I've seen, and they won't be the last." He stuck a cigarette on his lower lip, flicked a match alight and set fire to the cigarette.

"Where am I?" Lois asked, her voice unsteady.

"On Sherman's yacht," the man with the scar told her. "He'll be along in a little while. He wants to talk to you."

"Who are you?" Lois asked, half sitting up.

"My name's Penn," he returned, and grinned. "I take care of Sherman's business. That's why I'm taking care of you. Anything more you want to know?"

"Why has he brought me here?"

"He wants to talk to you. Between you and me and the bedpost, sister, I don't think you're going to live much longer," Penn said, and winked. "He's knocking them off so fast, I've given up counting the bodies. He knocked off Corinne tonight. A waste of a good body—but he's like that. Did you know he stretched her neck?"

Lois' heart skipped a beat and she felt suddenly sick. "Maybe if you're nice to me," Penn went on, "I might talk him out of it. Think you would be nice to me?"

"If you come near me, I'll scream!" Lois said, fiercely.

Penn nodded, and flicked ash onto the floor.

"When Sherman's off the boat, you can scream your lungs out," he said. "There's no one within six miles of us. Well, okay, if you want it the hard way, I don't care. I like a little opposition."

Lois didn't say anything. She looked quickly around the cabin for a way of escape, but the only way out was through the door against which Penn had placed his chair.

Penn cocked his head on one side, then got to his feet. "He's coming now," he said. "Watch your step, sister; he gets mean if he's crossed."

As he moved the chair from the door, the door opened and Sherman looked into the cabin. He stood in the doorway, his jaws moving, his amber-colored eyes on Lois, his hands in his pockets.

"Get out!" he said to Penn.

The big man went past him without a word, and closed the door after him.

Sherman pulled up the chair, and sat down.

"Sorry I had to hit you, Miss Marshall," he said, mildly. "But you came at an inconvenient moment. Why did you come?"

"Why have you brought me here," Lois demanded, swinging her legs off the bed and sitting up.

"You will answer my question," Sherman said, a sudden rasp in his voice. "If you're going to be truculent, I'll call Penn, and he'll deal with you. Why did you come to Corinne English's house?"

Lois hesitated. The cold, expressionless eyes scared her, but she had no intention of telling Sherman that she had hoped to persuade Corinne to give evidence against him.

"I heard about the scene she had made at the Silver Tower," she said, quietly. "I wanted to find out if Mr. English had seen her home."

Sherman studied her, not sure if she were lying or not.

"You don't know where English is?"

She shook her head.

"Are you sure?"

Again she shook her head.

"You know, of course, he killed Julie Clair and her lover tonight, and the police are hunting for him?"

"I heard they had been murdered, but I'm sure Mr. English had nothing to do with it."

Sherman smiled.

"Of course—you're in love with him. I should have thought of that before."

Lois didn't say anything.

,cYou are in love with him, aren't you?"

"Is it any of your business?"

"It could be," Sherman said, staring at her thoughtfully. "The police haven't picked him up yet, and when a man like English is running around loose, he's dangerous. I want him picked up quickly or I'll have to do something about him myself."

"You'd better let me go," Lois said firmly. "Kidnaping is a serious offense."

Sherman smiled.

"So is murder. But I don't care to kill you just yet. I shall wait until tomorrow morning. Then if English hasn't been arrested, I must find him myself, and that's where you come in. I don't think it'll be difficult if he gets to know I'm holding you. I have an idea he'll come to terms, then, of course, he will commit suicide like his brother. They'll find him shot, with a gun in his hand. They'll find you some time later conveniently drowned, and they'll assume you died like Mary Savitt died —because you were unable to go on living without your lover. It is a convenient method, and I see no reason why I shouldn't repeat it."

"I think you must be mad," Lois said, steadily. "No one sane could talk as you do."

Sherman shrugged.

"What if I am mad? What's wrong with being mad, anyway. Why have people such a horror of being thought mad? I haven't. I'm perfectly satisfied with the way my mind works. After all, madness is just a matter of viewpoint. You say you're sane. Well, look at you. I'm not in your position. A man in what they call his right mind would shrink from murder, and as it happens murder is my only way out. I don't shrink from it—therefore, I must be mad according to you." He crossed one leg over the other. "Murder is an odd thing. It's like a snowball running down a hill. One murder leads to another. I wouldn't be in this jam if that cheap little chiseler hadn't tried to gyp me. I was a fool to have picked on him to work for me. Before he came, I had a good business. Now, if I'm not very careful, the bottom could drop out of it. It's worth a quarter of a million to me, and I'm not giving that up without a fight. I killed Roy English in a moment of anger. It would have been simpler to have kicked him out and got someone else to do the work, but I was angry when I found out he was cheating me, and I shot him. Then the snowball started running down hill. Mary Savitt had to go. She knew as much about me as English did; and when she heard he was dead, she would talk. So she had to go. Then that old fool Hennessey got garrulous, and he had to go. But by that time, your clever Mr. English was on to me. He was unwise to threaten me. At first, I thought I would kill him, but it seemed simpler and more amusing to let him ruin himself in his own way. I arranged that he should hear about his mistress and Harry Vince. I couldn't be sure he would kill them, so I did it for him. Then you had to come along and I realized Corinne English could be dangerous, so she had to go. You see, I'm being frank with you. Murder is an interesting subject—it grows and grows. Soon I shall kill you, then English. It might stop there, but there's Leon to think about. He knows too much. I shall probably have to silence him. Then someone else will have to be silenced. One murder starts a chain of others. Interesting, isn't it?"

Lois didn't say anything. She stared at Sherman, horror in her eyes.

"English worries me," Sherman went on, half to himself. "He's dangerous. He's like a bull—he'll charge against any odds, and he might make things different for me unless he's arrested very soon."

"He will make things difficult for you," Lois said. "But don't think he'll care what happens to me. He won't. He's ruthless like that. I mean nothing to him, so don't imagine you can use me to trap him, because it won't work. He'll come after you in bis own way and in his own time. You can be sure of that!"

Sherman laughed.

"You don't believe that," he said, and got to his feet. "Whatever else he is, English is the chivalrous type. You and he have worked together for some time. Even if you don't mean anything to him, he'll come charging along like a mad bull when he hears you are in danger. That type always does. But it may not be necessary. I'll wait until tomorrow morning, then if the cops haven't picked him up, I'll set my trap. He'll walk into it"

He opened the door, and motioned Penn back into the room.

"Watch her," he said, curtly. "I'll come on board again by ten o'clock tomorrow."

Penn smiled.

"She'll be right here when you get back," he said.

"She'd better be," Sherman returned, and went away along the narrow corridor to the companion hatch.

Penn lolled against the doorway, his face smirking. He stood there for several minutes, not moving, his head cocked on one side. Then they both heard the roar of a motorboat engine as it started up. Still Perm remained leaning against the doorway. Lois watched him, her cold hands clenched in her lap.

They stared at each other until the sound of the motor died away, then Penn came into the cabin and closed the door. He turned the key, took it from the lock and put it in his pocket.
