### Chapter 4

The elevator that was nearly opposite English's door was coming up. It stopped, and a youngish man in a well-cut brown suit, a white silk handkerchief tucked up his sleeve and a brown slouch hat set squarely on his head, got out. He gave English a quick, searching glance, then began to move along the passage to the other apartment that was at the end of the passage.

"Mr. Sherman," English said quietly.

The man in the brown suit paused. He had the most extraordinary eyes English had ever seen—they were amber-colored with huge pupils, and they were as expressionless as two yellow buttons.

"Why, yes, I'm Sherman," he said. His voice was low pitched and musical, and he smiled at English, showing small, white teeth. "Did you want me? It's Nick English, isn't it?"

"Yes, that's right." He went on to Sherman, "I did want a word with you. Perhaps you'd care to step in for a moment?"

"I wonder if you'd mind coming along to my apartment?" Sherman said. "I'm expecting a telephone call and it's important."

"Certainly," English replied and closed the front door, moving along the passage at Sherman's side.

Sherman unlocked his door, reached forward and turned on the light, then stood aside.

"Please go ahead, Mr. English."

English walked into an ornate lobby that seemed full of flowers. He turned and watched Sherman close the door. Sherman hung his hat on the rack, ran a small, white hand over his flaxen hair, and opened the door facing him. He reached in and pressed light buttons, and lights sprang up in the room.

He stood aside, motioning English to enter.

It took a lot to startle English but this room brought him to an abrupt halt, and he stood staring around, his face clearly showing his astonishment.

It was a big room. English was aware first of a feeling of space—a vast stretch of polished floor spread out before him. There was no carpet or rugs to break up mat stretch of flooring. It seemed to go on and on until it finished up against long black velvet drapes that covered the windows.

A white corded settee and two white lounge chairs cringed in the empty space. In the alcove by the window, stood a grand piano. There was a big fireplace where a log fire burned brightly, and on either side of it stood six-foot-high black candles with small electric lamps imitating candle flames.

"As a showman, Mr. English, you should appreciate this room," Sherman said, moving over to the fireplace. "At least, it is original, isn't it? Of course, not many people would care to live in it, but then I'm not like most people."

"I agree with you," said English drily. "But I mustn't keep you. I wanted to ask if you called on the News Service Agency at 1356 Seventh Street on the seventeenth of this month."

Sherman slowly unpeeled the wrapping on the gum package, his expressionless eyes on English's face.

"I believe I did," he said. "I can't be sure if I went there on the seventeenth, but it was some evening this week. It could be the seventeenth, come to think of it."

"I have a reason for asking," English said. "You went there about ten-fifteen?"

"It is possible. I didn't particularly notice."

"At about that time, my brother committed suicide," English said, his eyes on Sherman's face. "He shot himself."

Sherman lifted his eyebrows.

"How very unpleasant for you," he said, took a piece of gum from the package and put it into his mouth. "I'm sorry."

"Did you hear a shot when you were in the building?"

"So it was a shot," Sherman said. "I did hear something and it crossed my mind that it was a shot, but I finally decided it must have been a car backfiring."

"Where were you when you heard the shot?"

"I was coming up in the elevator."

"Did you see anyone in the sixth floor passage or coming out of my brother's office?"

"Had your brother an office on the sixth floor?" Sherman asked. "There is a Detective Agency and the News Service Agency on that floor, if I remember rightly. Where would your brother's office be?"

"He owned the Detective Agency."

Sherman's jaws moved rhythmically.

"Did he? That's interesting. I had no idea your brother was a detective," he said, and his tone implied that he didn't think anything of detectives.

"Did you see anyone near my brother's office?" English repeated.

Sherman frowned.

"Why, yes. Come to think of it, I did, I saw a girl up there. She was wearing a rather smart black and white outfit. I remember thinking for the type of girl she so obviously was, she had a flair for clothes."

With an expressionless face, English asked, "And what type of girl was she, Mr. Sherman?"

Sherman smiled.

"The type of girl who wouldn't have too many ethics."

English's eyes were cold and hard as he said, "And this girl was in the passage when you came up in the elevator?"

"That's right. She was walking away from the agency, making for the stairs."

"You saw no one else?"

"No."

"How long would you say was it that you heard the shot and saw the girl?"

"About five or six seconds."

"Well, thanks," English said, suddenly realizing where Sherman's answers were leading. "I guess I won't keep you any longer. You've told me all that I wanted to know."

"That's fine," Sherman said. "I suppose your brother did commit suicide, Mr. English?"

"That's what I said," English returned curtly.

"Yes, so you did. But detectives do appear to lead dangerous lives. I wonder if your brother discovered something unpleasant about this girl, and she shot him to silence him."

English smiled bleakly.

"My brother shot himself, Mr. Sherman.."

Sherman nodded.

"Well, you know best, Mr. English. I wonder what the girl was doing in your brother's office. He must have shot himself while she was actually in the room. Of course, the girl could be easily traced," he went on absently. "I should imagine she worked in some night club. She looked the type." He ran his fingers through his flaxen hair, ruffling it so that he suddenly appeared almost boyish as he smiled at English. "I'm an artist, Mr. English. You wouldn't know that, of course, but I'm rather clever at creating a likeness. It would be a very easy task for me to provide the police with a picture of this girl. Do you think I should do that?"

"The police are satisfied that my brother shot himself," English said quietly. "I don't think you need bother to supply them with a picture. Thank you for your help."

"Only too glad," Sherman said. He continued to chew, his hands in his pockets, his face lit by a smile. "As a matter of fact, I had been hoping to have the opportunity of talking to you. After all, you are quite a celebrity.

"I suppose I am," English said, moving toward the door. "Good night, Mr. Sherman."

"I guess if the police knew about Miss Clair, it might be very awkward for her, and unpleasant for you," Sherman said, raising his voice slightly. "After all, she did have a very good reason for shooting your brother, didn't she?"

"Miss—who?" English asked, politely interested.

"Julie Clair, your mistress," Sherman returned. "Her motive and my evidence could put her in jail for quite a long time. She might even go to the chair, although if she flashed her legs at the jury, she would probably avoid that. But she would get at least ten years. You wouldn't like that, would you, Mr. English?"



II

There was a pause while the two men looked at each other, then English came back slowly to the center of the room.

"No," he said, speaking quietly. "I shouldn't like that. Are you quite sure the girl you saw was Miss Clair?"

Sherman made a little gesture' of impatience with his hand. "I know you are a very busy man," he said, "but you-might feel inclined to discuss the situation now rather than later, but please yourself. I'm in no hurry."

"What is there to discuss?" English said.

"Wouldn't it save time if we stopped behaving like a couple of clubmen at a social gathering?" Sherman said sharply. "I own a piece of information and I am prepared to sell it to you. That's what there is to discuss."

"I see," English said, raising his eyebrows. "This is a surprise. I was wondering if you would have the nerve to try to blackmail me." Sherman smiled.

\*To me, Mr. English, you are just a rich man. Your importance and fame leave me indifferent. You have the money and I have the information. I can either sell it to you or to Miss Clair. I would prefer to sell it to you as I would be able to ask a much higher price; but if you are not inclined to make a deal, I must go to her."

"I was under the impression that you already have dealings with her," English said mildly. "She has been paying you two hundred dollars a week, hasn't she?"

Sherman's eyes blinked, then he smiled.

"I don't usually betray a buyer's confidence, but as she has obviously told you about it, then I see no harm in saying that we have a modest deal on together, but this new proposition would be a much larger deal, and it would be a cash payment."

"I don't think she could pay."

"Possibly not, then perhaps you would come to her assistance."

"What do you want for your information?" English asked.

"From you, I should think a fair price would be two hundred and fifty thousand in cash," Sherman said. "From her, I don't suppose I could get more than fifty thousand. But if I sold to her, I couldn't guarantee that the press wouldn't discover your brother was a professional blackmailer. For the larger sum, I should be able to guarantee it"

English's face was expressionless, his eyes unworried.

"How did Roy happen to get mixed up with you?" he asked.

Sherman leant his shoulders against the mantel while he studied English, a slightly puzzled expression in his eyes.

"Need we go into that?" he said. "We are discussing a deal if I may take your mind back to business."

"There's plenty of time to talk about that," English returned airily. "How did Roy happen to get mixed up with you?"

Sherman hesitated, then shrugging his shoulders, he said, "Your brother was anxious to make some easy money. His agency was a convenient place for my clients to go and settle their accounts with me without causing embarrassment to either side. I paid your brother well. He collected 10 per cent of the gross."

"I see," said English. "And he decided that 10 per cent wasn't enough. He attempted to help himself. Probably he held out on you. He was planning to go away with his secretary, Mary Savitt, and no doubt he was anxious to lay his hands on a getaway stake. I assume you found out that he was cheating you, and you decided to teach him a lesson. On the night of the seventeenth, you went to his office, shot him through the head with his own gun, impressed his fingerprints on the gun butt and collected the card index containing the names of your customers before leaving. Am I right?"

Sherman continued to smile, but his eyes were now wary.

"I believe something like that did happen," he said. "Naturally, you wouldn't expect me to swear to it before a jury, but between ourselves, since we are talking off the record, something very much like that did happen."

English nodded, and blew smoke toward the ceiling.

"You then went to Mary Savitt's apartment. You strangled her and strung her up against the bathroom door. I assume you silenced her because she knew what Roy had been doing and could have told the police that you had the motive for murdering him."

"You appear to keep yourself very well informed, Mr. English," Sherman said.

"During the late afternoon," Mr. English went on, "a man named Hennessey called at the Alert Agency to pay his dues. He met the present occupant who persuaded him to talk. Somehow you managed to overhear the conversation, and you murdered Hennessey by running him down in your car."

There was a long pause of silence while Sherman studied English. His smile was fixed now, and his eyes were uneasy.

"All this is very interesting, Mr. English," he said at last, "but suppose we get back to our business deal. I have an appointment in half an hour."

English smiled.

"You don't really imagine you can blackmail me, do you?" he asked.

"Yes, I see no reason why not," Sherman returned, his voice hardening. "It would be no hardship for you to find a quarter of a million. The advantages of paying are considerable. Up to now, you have made a big impression on this city. You are anxious to have the hospital named after you. You have done the city a lot of good. It would be a pity to spoil your good name because you happen to have a brother who failed to live up to your own high standards. I think you would be extremely foolish not to make a deal with me."

"But I don't have to make a deal with you," English said mildly, "It is you who have to try to make a deal with me."

"What do you mean?" Sherman asked, frowning.

"I should have thought it is obvious. Within the past three days, you have murdered three people. I hold your life in my hands."

Sherman made an impatient gesture.

"Surely that is an exaggeration. There is a considerable difference in making a guess and proving it."

"I won't need to prove it. You will have to prove you didn't kill these people."

"I'm afraid you're wasting time," Sherman said sharply. "Are you going to buy my information or do I have to go to your mistress?"

English laughed.

"I had the mistaken idea that when I found the man who murdered my brother, I was going to take the law into my own hands. At the back of my mind, I was prepared to shoot him. I know that my brother was a weak, gutless fool, but in my family we have a tradition. We bury our own dead. So I had made up my mind that I would find Roy's murderer myself and deal with him." He leaned forward to flick ash into the fire. "Well, I have found him but the circumstances have changed. I have also discovered that my brother was not only a cheap cheat but he was also a blackmailer, and to me, Mr. Sherman, a blackmailer is lower than any other form of life. If you hadn't killed him, then I should have. In fact, Mr. Sherman, I am moderately grateful to you for ridding me of Roy."

Sherman's face was now set, and his yellow eyes gleamed.

"All this is very interesting, but it doesn't answer my question. Are you paying me or do I have to go to your mistress?"

"I'm certainly not paying you," English said, "and Miss Clair isn't paying you either."

"Then you give me no other alternative but to go elsewhere with my information," Sherman said.

"Nor will you take your information elsewhere," English returned. "Up to now you've been blackmailing people who don't know how to hit back. I do."

"That remains to be seen," Sherman said.

"You don't seem to realize what you've taken on by trying to blackmail me," English said, stretching out his long legs. "I have a lot of money and a lot of influence. I have many useful friends. When dealing with a blackmailer, I should not hesitate to throw aside all scruples. I have already told you— I don't regard a blackmailer as a human being. I would treat him as I would treat a rat that happens to find its way into my room. I would exterminate him without mercy and by any means, and that is what I am prepared to do with you. At the moment, I've no evidence against you that would stand up in court, but in two or three days I shall have the evidence. I admit that it would cost money, but then I have money. Having got my evidence, perjured or legal, I shall then talk to the judge who will try you. I know all the judges in the city, and they are all anxious to do me a favor. I will arrange to see the jury before they try you, and I will promise them a reward if they bring in a guilty verdict. Once you are arrested, Mr. Sherman, I guarantee you will be dead in a few months. Make no mistake about that"

"You don't think you can scare me, do you?" Sherman said. "I make a point always to call a bluff."

"There comes a time when you can call a bluff once too often," English returned. "I admit if I handed you over to the police, it wouldn't be possible to keep the shabby news that my brother was a blackmailer out of the papers. I admit that I would cook my own goose in this city by having you arrested, but rather than submit to blackmail or let Miss Clair submit to blackmail, I shan't hesitate to go after you; and once I do go after you, no power on earth can save you from the electric chair." He got up abruptly and began to pace up and down, his hands clasped behind his back, his face thoughtful. "I can't allow you to remain in the city, nor can I allow you to continue to levy blackmail. I am going to make you a proposal. It doesn't suit me at the moment to hand you over to the police. Instead, you are to leave town by the end of the week. You are not to return. You are to give up your blackmailing activities. If you don't leave, I shall hand you over to the police. If you think I'm bluffing, go ahead and stay in this apartment and see what happens to you. I promise you, if it's its last thing I do, I'll have you in the electric chair within six months. If this apartment isn't empty by Saturday night, you will be arrested on Sunday morning. I shall not warn you again. Get out of town by Saturday night or take the consequences."

Sherman had gone pale, and his yellow eyes showed his suppressed fury.

"A war is never won until the last battle, Mr. English," he said, his voice unsteady.

English looked at him and made a grimace of disgust.

"This happens to be the last battle," he said, opened the front door and walked slowly down the passage.
