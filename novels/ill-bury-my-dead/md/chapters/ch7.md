### Chapter 7

Ed Leon drove slowly past Lois' walk-up, his eyes alert for the first sign of trouble, but there was no police car outside the building nor did a light show. He pulled up at the corner of the street and walked back to look up at the window.

Had English given Morilli the slip? Sam Crail should know, he decided, and he returned to the car.

If English had been arrested, then it was up to him to find Lois, Leon told himself as he slid under the driving wheel. But where to look for her? Sherman wouldn't take her to his apartment. He probably had some other place where he could duck her out of sight—but where?

In the next street, Leon spotted an all-night drugstore. He swung the car to the curb and went in, crossing to a pay booth. He shut himself in, and dialed Crail's number. He dropped the receiver back on to the cradle when he heard the busy signal, and fumbled for a cigarette. Then he remembered Gloria Windsor. Maybe she knew if Sherman had a hide-out He dialed Crail's number again.

"Hello!" Crail's voice snapped in his ear. "That you, Leon?"

"Yeah—so they got Nick?"

"He phoned a couple of minutes ago. The cops were at the door while he was talking to me. I'm on my way to headquarters now. Goddam it! He should have given himself up as I said."

"Don't blow your stack," Leon said, shortly. "Lois is missing; looks like Sherman's got her. Corinne English has been murdered."

"What are you talking about?" Crail demanded, his voice shooting up.

"Lois went over to Corinne's place. Nick reckoned that Corinne and Sherman were working together. Lois was going to bring her back so Nick could talk to her. Lois didn't come back, so I went to see what had happened. I found Corinne strangled, and Lois missing. I found her handkerchief. I've got to find her, Crail. Tell Nick I'm going to put pressure on this Windsor girl. She's our only chance. Tell him not to worry. I'll find Lois if it kills me."

"Who's the Windsor girl?" Crail asked, blankly.

"Never mind. Tell him. He knows who she is. I've got to get moving."

"Keep in touch with me," Crail said, urgently.

"Sure. I'll call you back after I've talked to this girl," Leon said, and hung up.

He left the pay booth, and went back to his car. Ten minutes' fast driving brought him to Seventh Street, and he pulled up outside the building that housed the Alert Agency, got into the elevator and slammed the grill.

The elevator creaked upwards. It finally came to rest on the top floor, and Leon stepped out into the passage. The clatter of the teletypers from the news agency covered the sound of the grill opening. There was a light shining through the transom above Gloria Windsor's door.

He walked along the passage, lifted the brass knocker and rapped twice.

After a delay, a bolt shot back.

A tall, redheaded girl in a green high neck sweater and a pair of fawn-colored slacks looked at him. She was around twenty-eight or \-nine. Her face had an alert beauty, marred by a hard mouth and an overaggressive chin. Leon thought she had the most provocative shape he had ever seen on a woman.

"Miss Windsor?" he asked, tipping his hat.

Gray eyes looked into his. Scarlet lips twisted into half a smile.

"Sure. What do you want?"

"I'm Ed Leon," Leon told her. "I'm a detective. I want to talk to you."

She continued to smile, but her eyes grew suddenly wary.

"Don't kid me," she said, scornfully. "If you're a flatfoot, then I'm Sophie Tucker."

Leon flashed his badge.

"Does that convince you?"

"Oh, a shamus," she said, with withering contempt. "Run along, boy scout, I can't be bothered with amateurs."

She began to close the door, but Leon's foot was in the way. He moved forward.

"I said I wanted to talk to you," he told her.

She gave ground, her gray eyes angry.

"You're going to walk into a load of grief, shamus," she said, "if you try to force yourself on me."

"It's a risk I'll gladly take," Leon said, inside the room now. He closed the door and leaned against it. "It's not often I have the opportunity of forcing myself upon a redhead as well stacked as you."

A hint of a smile came into the gray eyes.

"A smooth guy!" she said, in mock despair. "I meet them twenty-four hours a day. Well, now you're in, say your piece and beat it."

"We're not in yet," Leon said, and stepped past her. He pushed open a door and walked into a large, airy room. "Well, you know how to make yourself comfortable," he went on, looking around. "My, my! You must be doing pretty well with your silhouette."

"Put that in the plural, or I'll take a poke at your left eye," she said, languidly, and walked over to a deep armchair and sank into it.

"Or maybe it's the blackmail racket that's paying off," Leon said, watching her.

She looked at him out of the corners of her eyes, and her mouth tightened.

"What are you talking about?" she demanded, frostily.

"You're in trouble, baby," Leon said, moving over to the fireplace and standing before the bright fire. "This is the wind-up for you. How do you like the idea of spending the next ten years in a nice, cosy jail?"

She looked up at him, her eyes jeering.

"What makes you think I'm going to jail, shamus?"

"Facts and figures—not your figure, mathematical ones," Leon said, taking out a pack of cigarettes. "Smoke?"

She shook her head.

"What facts and figures?"

Leon lit up, and flicked the match into the fire.

"Sherman's racket has blown up in his face. We've got all we want on him. While we're waiting for him to show, we're picking up the small fry like you."

She raised her eyebrows.

"Who's Sherman? What are you talking about?"

Leon smiled.

"Don't give me that stuff. You know what I'm talking about. You fingered Roy English. You're Sherman's sounding board. Everything that went on in English's office was heard by you and passed on to Sherman."

"Aw, you're crazy!" she exclaimed, angrily. "Get out of here before I call the cops."

"Go ahead and call them. It'll save me the trouble of dragging you down to headquarters."

She got out of the chair and walked over to the telephone.

"The cops in this town know how to deal with a louse like you," she said. "Take a tip and beat it!"

"Go ahead and call them," he said, leaning against the wall. "I've got enough on you to put you away for ten years. Blackmail comes high these days."

"You can't prove a thing," she said.

"I can tie you in with Sherman. Within the last few days, he's knocked off six people—Roy English, Mary Savitt, Joe Hennessey, Julie Clair, Harry Vince, and, an hour ago, Corinne English," Leon said, watching her. "You're tied in to Roy's killing. I can prove that. If you're not careful, they'll put this nice body of yours in the chair."

She half turned as she lifted the receiver, then she slammed it down, jerked open a drawer and whipped out a .25 automatic. She spun around and pointed the gun at Leon.

"Don't move, shamus," she said, her face hard and her eyes glittering. "I'm tempted to put a slug in you, and tell the cops you broke in here."

"What—with that toy? It wouldn't even make me bleed," Leon said, not feeling as confident as he sounded.

"You make a move, and we'll see if it would make you bleed!"

"Where's this going to get you?" he asked. "Why don't you use your head and do the sensible thing?"

"And what's that?" she demanded, resting her hips against the table, the gun sight centered on his chest.

"I want Sherman," he said. "I could afford to let you go. He's ducked out of sight"

She studied him.

"Suppose I talk, what then, shamus?"

"I'd give you twelve hours to pull out of town. After twelve hours, I'd have to tell the cops you were working with Sherman, but a girl with your assets can get a long way in twelve hours."

"I don't know anything about Sherman," she laughed. "Why, you're crazy! I never heard of the guy until you walked in here. Now, get out!"

"Okay, if that's the way you want to play it, don't blame me if you land in the chair."

"Get out!"

"A one track mind," Leon remarked, and moved over to the door. "I forgot to mention that there'd be a getaway stake thrown in with my offer of a twelve hour start. I wouldn't expect a girl like you to take a powder without a little folding money to keep her warm."

When he saw her stiffen, he knew that he'd struck the right note.

"Keep going," she said, but she didn't sound quite so convincing this time.

As he reached the door, she said, "How much?"

"A couple of grand. That's not a bad proposition, sister— two grand and twelve hours start."

"Not interested," she said, curtly. "That's chicken feed. Get out of here!"

"Suppose you make a suggestion."

She hesitated.

"Ten."

Leon laughed.

"That's funny. Ten grand for something the cops could beat out of you. But I'll go to five because redheads soothe my ulcer."

"Seven," she said promptly.

Leon realized he was wasting time.

"Do you know where Sherman is?" he asked.

She nodded.

"Well, okay. What have I got to lose? It isn't my dough. I'll close at seven. Where is he?"

"Do I look all that damp behind the ears?" she said, scornfully. "I want the dough first."

"Where is he?" Leon barked, suddenly losing his nonchalant air. "You'll get the money but you'll talk first!"

"I want the money first," she returned, obstinately.

He grabbed her by her arm.

"Listen. Sherman has kidnapped English's secretary! He's taken her somewhere. If I don't find her fast, he'll knock her off; and if he does, I'll damn well see that you're tied in with him. Where is he?"

She hesitated.

"You'll give me the money and twelve hours start, if I tell you?"

"Yes. Where is he?"

"Where's the money coming from?"

"Sam Crail, the attorney, will give it to you."

She hesitated, and then said "He's got a yacht anchored off Bay Creek. That's where he spends his weekends. If he's anywhere, that's where he'll be. You can't miss it—it's the only yacht anchored there."

"Is this on the level?" Leon demanded.

"Of course it is! Now\*, how do I collect the dough?"

Leon went over to the desk by the window, pulled a sheet of note paper from a pigeonhole and scribbled a note. He handed it to her.

"Give that to Crail. Tell him what you've told me, and he'll pay you."

"If he doesn't . . . !"

"He'll do it," said Leon, making for the door. "Maybe not tonight, but first thing in the morning. You'll still have twelve hours start. I promise you that."

When he had gone, she stood, thinking, her eyes worried, then she went swiftly into her bedroom, pulled out two suitcases from under her bed, and began to pack hurriedly.

Without bothering to change out of sweater and slacks, she pulled on a fur coat, picked up her two suitcases and went swiftly to the front door. She jerked it open, and then came to an abrupt stop, her heart skipping a beat.

Sherman was standing in the passage, his hands in his pockets, water dripping from his hat brim, his jaws moving slowly, his eyes expressionless.

"Hello, Gloria," he said, quietly.

She didn't say anything.

"Running away?" he went on, his eyes going to the two suitcases.

"What do you mean?" she managed to get out. "I'm only going away for the weekend."

"But not coming back?" he said. "Got cold feet, Gloria?"

"Why should I have cold feet?" she said, struggling to keep her voice steady. "What's the matter with you? Can't I go away for a weekend without your imagining things?"

Sherman smiled.

"Can I come in a moment?"

"I—I don't want to miss my train . . ."

He moved toward her, and she gave ground. He entered the living room. Slowly, as if hypnotized, she put the two suitcases on the floor and leaned against the wall, watching him.

"You don't have to run away, Gloria," he said, moving about the room. "I've got English where I want him. He can't cause trouble now. The cops are looking for him. He shot his girl friend."

She didn't say anything. Her eyes followed him as he moved over to the window.

"It looked at first as if he could stop me," Sherman went on, "but it's all right now. How are you fixed for dough, Gloria? I think I owe you something, don't I?"

"I'm all right," she said huskily. "I—I don't need anything at the moment."

He smiled at her.

"First time I've ever known you to say that. Perhaps you're scared of taking my money now, Gloria? You don't have to be."

"If you've got it, I'll have it," she said, "but I'm not hard up."

"No, I don't suppose you are." He had stopped by the window, and was examining the curtain cord. "Now, this is an odd coincidence. I've been looking for a cord like this for weeks. You may not believe it but I can't find this exact shade anywhere." He took the cord off the hook and appeared to examine it closely. "Do you remember where you got it?"

"From Sackville's," Gloria said, watching him uneasily.

"Are you sure?" he asked, moving casually toward her. "I think I tried there."

She looked at the cord, seeing it now hanging in a loop between his fingers, and she tried to screw herself into the wall, her eyes opening wide with terror.

"Keep away from me!" she said in a tight, strangled voice.

He was within a few feet of her, now. She suddenly threw herself blindly across the room to the door. He went after her with quick, silent steps, and as she reached the door, he dropped the loop over her head.

Her frantic scream of terror was throttled back into her throat as he crossed his hands and tightened the cord.

As Sam Crail got out of his car, a man came out of the darkness.

"Sam?"

"Why, Nick!" Crail looked uneasily to right and left, scared anyone might be watching. "What the hell are you doing here?"

"Let's get inside," English said, his voice tense.

Crail snapped off the car's headlights, and then led the way up the dark path to his house. He opened the door, and English followed him into the lobby.

Helen Crail came out of the sitting room. She was a tall, willowy girl with light brown hair and shrewd friendly eyes.

"Come in by the fire, Nick," she said, smiling at him. "I'll get you a drink."

"No, please don't, Helen," English said. "I'm all right."

Helen looked swiftly at Crail, who shook his head.

"Heard from Ed yet?" English asked.

"I've heard from him," Crail returned, following English into the big, brightly lit sitting room. He took off his coat and dropped into a chair. "Take your coat off. You're sopping wet." As English took off his coat, Crail went on; "What happened to you? I went down to headquarters and waited. Captain Swinney hadn't any information. He said there was a call out for you. I didn't tell him you'd been found. Did you give him the slip?"

English smiled grimly.

"Eventually. Morilli staged a private arrest for his own benefit. What's happened to Lois?"

"I don't know. Ed's looking for her. He said he was calling me back in an hour. He should come through at any minute now."

Helen took English's coat and hung it in the hall.

"Did he say what he found when he arrived at Corinne's place?" English asked.

Crail nodded.

"Yes. Sherman had been there. He strangled Corinne. Lois had been there, too. Ed found her handkerchief, but we don't know if Sherman has her or not."

English clenched his fists, his pale face hardening.

"He's got to be stopped, Sam! This can't go on. I've got to find him."

"Now, look, you're in a bad spot yourself," Crail said anxiously. "You should have given yourself up when Morilli came for you. Running away from him . . ."

"I didn't run away from him. I let him arrest me," English said as Helen came back into the sitting room. "He took me for a ride. If Chuck hadn't spotted us leaving and got himself a ride on the rear bumper, I'd be in the morgue by now."

Crail stared at him.

"You aren't serious?"

"You bet I'm serious. Morilli made no bones about it. He was scared I'd talk. He was about to shoot me when Chuck showed up. And that's the deal I'd get if I gave myself up. They'll frame me into the chair if I give them half a chance."

Crail wiped his face with his handkerchief.

"I'll go to the Commissioner right now and tell him," he said. "He'll have to listen to me. Where did you say you've left Morilli?"

"Hampton Wharf," English told him. "Chuck is with him. Take a newspaper man with you, Sam. It's a good idea. Maybe Morilli will give himself away."

"Leave it to me," Crail said, putting on his coat again. "In the meantime, you stay here, Nick, and keep out of sight. I'll fix that rat, Morilli!"

"You're harboring a suspect," English pointed out. "Maybe I'd better move on, Sam."

"You stay here! See that he does, Helen," Crail said. "They won't think to look here for you. I'll be back as soon as I can."

When he had gone out to the garage, Helen said, "You're worrying about Lois, aren't you, Nick?"

He nodded.

"If that devil's killed her . . ."

"You mustn't think like that," she said, soothingly. "Sit down and rest. Ed will find her."

"But the police are looking for him, now, and he doesn't know it. Morilli put out a call for him."

'Trust him to keep out of trouble," she returned.

English flopped down in an armchair.

"If I only knew where Sherman is," he said, angrily. "I can't go out looking all over the town. I'd be picked up within minutes."

"Ed said he was going to talk to some girl—Windsor, I think he said her name was. He thought she might know where Sherman is."

English's face brightened.

"I'd forgotten her. Ed thinks she's working with Sherman. I wonder if he got anywhere with her."

"He'll call in a little while," Helen said.

"He may be with her now," English said, jumping to his feet. "I might get him on the phone."

He went over to the telephone and riffled through the pages of the directory until he found Gloria Windsor's number. He dialed and waited. The line was busy.

"No answer. Maybe she's out, and he hasn't talked to her yet." He looked at his watch. "When I think of Lois . . ." He drove his fist into his palm. "Goddam it! I must do something! I can't just sit and wait!"

"Take it easy, Nick," Helen said. "You've got to rely on Ed."

"It's all very well . . ." He broke off and smiled crookedly at her. "You know, I've been a mug about Lois, Helen. I didn't realize what she meant to me until I'd lost her."

"Aren't we all mugs sometimes?" she returned, gently. "I'm glad, Nick. She's been good to you."

"I know. Well, if she's alive, I'll make up for it."

"Listen!" Helen said, sharply, holding up her hand.

They heard the sound of a fast-moving car, coming down the street. A moment later, it pulled up outside the house with a squeal of tortured tires.

As English moved to the window, Helen pushed him aside.

"You must keep out of sight, Nick. It may be the police," she said, sharply. "Let me see."

She lifted the shade, then turned swiftly, her face alight with excitement

"It's Ed!" she exclaimed, and ran across the room to the front door.

Leon was soaked with rain, and there was an anxious, harassed look in his eyes.

"Sam in?" he asked.

"Come in," Helen said. "Nick's here."

"What a break," Leon said to English. "I'd given you up as lost."

"Where's Lois?" Nick demanded.

"I'm not sure yet. I came here for some money. I've got to hire a boat Sherman has a yacht six miles off Bay Creek. It's my bet Lois is on board. Have you got a hundred bucks?"

"Of course, I have," English said. "I'm coming with you."

"Better not. The cops are still looking for you."

"They're looking for you, too," English said. "Morula's put a call out for you. He's going to pin Corinne's murder on you. Come on, let's get going!"

He struggled into his overcoat

"How far is Bay Creek?" he asked.

"About three miles from here," Leon said, opening the front door.

'Tell Sam where I've gone," English said to Helen. "And thanks for putting up with me."

"Good luck, Nick," Helen said, her eyes anxious. "And be careful."

Leon sent the car shooting down the deserted street

"I got the Windsor girl to talk," he told English, "but it's going to cost you seven grand, and it may come to nothing. All the same, I imagine Sherman would take Lois to the yacht if he took her anywhere."

"Where's this Bay Creek, Ed?" English asked.

"You know the golf club? A mile further on is Bay Creek. There's a boathouse there. I've seen the yacht. It's anchored about six miles out in the bay. Someone's on board. Lights are showing, but the guy who owns the motorboat wouldn't play unless I paid him the hundred. I nearly went crazy trying to talk him into it, but the louse wouldn't budge."

English glanced over his shoulder.

"There's a car after us, Ed!" he said, his voice sharpening.

Leon promptly shoved his foot down hard on the gas pedal.

"Cops?"

"Could be. Maybe they spotted your number. I told you they were on the lookout for you."

"I can't hope to shake a prowl car in this old heap," Leon said. "What are we going to do?"

"Can't we lose them?"

"Not in this district." He looked in the driving mirror. "Hell! They're coming up fast!"

"You stall them, Ed. I'm going after Lois. Get around the next corner, slow down and let me drop off. I'll take my chance of giving them the slip."

"They're right behind us," Leon said. He shoved the gas pedal to the boards, and the car fell back a little. "Hang on tight. I'm going to take the next corner."

Twenty yards from the corner, Leon slammed on his brakes. The back of the car swung around in a violent skid. He heard the screaming tires as the other car braked frantically. Beams from the other car's headlamps lit up Leon's car as he wrestled with the wheel, steering into the skid. He released the brake, and trod on the gas pedal. The car shot into the side street. The pursuing car went on, braked violently as Leon slowed down.

"Good luck!" he exclaimed, as English opened the door.

English jumped out, took two staggering steps forward before falling heavily. He rolled over, staggered to his feet, and ran blindly for an alley facing him.

The police car had reversed and was swinging into the street as he reached the mouth of the alley. A voice yelled at him, but he didn't look around.

There was a flash and a crash of gunfire. Something zipped perilously close to his head, then he dashed into the darkness of the alley.

For some seconds he ran blindly. The alley led to the river, and he came out on the waterfront He heard the sound of pounding feet coming after him, and he looked to right and left for cover. A few yards from him, was a vast pile of empty wooden crates. He darted over to them and dodged behind them.

A moment later, a cop came out of the alley, gun in hand. He looked up and down the deserted waterfront, then stood listening. He came on and began to circle the pile of crates. Moving without a sound, English followed him, keeping just out of sight, until the two of them had made a complete circle of the crates.

With a grunt of disgust, the cop went off along the waterfront, using a powerful flashlight, his gun thrust forward.

English didn't move until the cop was out of sight, then he went off in the opposite direction, walking fast, his head bent against the driving rain.

He was about a mile from the golf club, and time was running out. He decided to risk a taxi. He made his way back toward town. As he walked along in the pouring rain, he wondered what had happened to Leon, and he wished he had a gun.

After walking for some minutes, he saw a taxi coming toward him, and he waved.

The taxi pulled up.

"Know the golf club?" he asked, keeping his head bent so the driver couldn't see his face clearly.

"Sure," the driver returned.

"A mile further on, there's a boathouse. That's where I want to go."

"I know it. Tom Kerr's place."

English got into the cab.

"Twenty bucks if you get me there in ten minutes."

"Can't be done, but I'll get you there in fifteen."

"Get going!"

Twelve minutes later, the driver said, "That's Kerr's joint right ahead."

English leaned forward to peer through the rain soaked windshield. He could see a big wooden shed by the river bank. Lights came through the windows.

He fumbled in his billfold and took out a twenty dollar bill.

"Want to wait?" he said. "I'll be coming back, but I may be some time. It rates another twenty."

"I'll wait all night for that kind of dough," the driver said, eagerly.

He swung down a steep slope that led directly to the shed, and pulled up.

"You'll find Kerr in that cabin down by the jetty," he told English, as he took the twenty dollar bill.

English walked quietly down the path to the cabin, and rapped on the door. A fat man in a turtle-neck sweater and thick rubber boots looked at him enquiringly.

"You Tom Kerr?" English asked.

"That's right, mister. Come in."

English stepped into a warm, pleasant room.

"I want a motorboat in a hurry," he said to Kerr. "How soon can you get one ready?"

Kerr looked sharply at him.

"What's the trouble, Mr. English?" he asked.

English smiled crookedly.

"I wish my face wasn't so familiar," he said. "I want to get to a yacht moored in Bay Creek."

"I'll take you there," Kerr said.

English wiped the rain off his face.

"Do you know the police are looking for me?" he asked. "I don't want to get you into trouble."

"I mind my own business. I'm glad to do something for you."

English nodded.

"I've more friends than I thought," he said.

They went out into the rain to a powerful speedboat that bobbed up and down on the heavy swell. Kerr helped him aboard, cast off, pushed forward the throttle and sent the boat shooting toward the bay.

"We didn't talk terms," English said, standing close to Kerr. "Would a hundred settle it?"

Kerr nodded.

"Anything you say, Mr. English."

"There may be some trouble on the yacht," English went on. "A girl I know has been kidnapped, and I think she's on board. Ill tackle it. You stay with the boat. I'll want you to take us back if she's there."

"If there's going to be any rough stuff, count me in," Kerr said, his face lighting up. "I used to be the Midwestern heavyweight champion before I married, and I haven't had any action in years."

"I guess I can use you if there are more than one of them."

They could see the lights of the yacht in the distance.

"Push her along," English said, impatiently.

Kerr pulled the throttle. The speedboat raced over the swells, throwing a foaming wash behind as it cleaved through the water.

English peered through the blinding spray, his eyes on the yacht. Out of the shelter of the bay, the wind whistled and the sea thundered. English thought it was unlikely that anyone on board would hear the approaching speedboat.

"Slow down," he said to Kerr, "and drift up to her. I don't want them to know we're coming."

The boat moving on its own impetus, ran on towards the yacht, and in a few minutes, Kerr brought it alongside.

English caught hold of the glittering brass rail, and steadied the boat while Kerr made it fast.

Then they both swung aboard.

"I'll go first," English said, under his breath. "You keep out of sight. If there's trouble, take them in the rear."

He moved softly to the companion hatch and paused to listen at the head of the stairway. Hearing nothing, he cautiously began to descend, and as he reached the bottom step, a cabin door toward the end of the passage, abruptly opened.

He crouched down, waiting, knowing he couldn't get along the passage before he was seen; nor had he time to get up the stairway and out of sight. If whoever it was coming out of the cabin, had a gun, he would be shot down before he could make a move.

Then he saw Lois.

She came out of the cabin, her face white, her eyes scared. Her white nylon blouse was torn off her shoulder, and her skirt was ripped at the waist.

"Lois!" English said, softly.

"Oh, Nick!" she said, and ran towards him.



III

Halfway down the stairway, Kerr stopped and gaped. He was expecting to run into real trouble, and the sight of English holding a girl in his arms, stopped him short.

But English was oblivious to Kerr's astonishment. He held Lois close to him, thankful to find her alive.

"Are you all right?" he asked, anxiously. "You're not hurt?"

"I'm all right. I thought it was Sherman coming back. Oh, Fm so glad to see you, Lois said, pushing away from him, embarrassed.

"My dear . . ." English began, then realized this was no time for idle talk. "Is there anyone else on board?" .

Lois shivered.

"There's Perm. He's in there." She pointed to another cabin. "I've been scared to go in there again. I hit him."

"You hit him?" Enghsh said blankly. "What happened?"

"He attacked me. I got away from him, and hit him over the head with a bottle. I—I think I may have killed him."

He could see she was struggling not to cry, and he put his arm around her.

"It's all right," he said. "I'm going to get you out of here." He looked over his shoulder at Kerr. "Take a look in there and see what's happened."

Kerr pushed past them, opened the cabin door, and went in. He came out after a minute of so, grinning.

"Well, you certainly did hit him, miss," he said, admiringly, but he's all right. He'll probably have a cracked skull, but he's not going to croak."

Lois leaned against English.

"I was so frightened he would die," she said, "but he was a brute."

"Come on," English said, "you're going home."

"No, wait," she said, catching hold of his arm. "This is important, Nick. There's something in the next cabin we must take with us."

"All right. Just a moment." English turned to Kerr. "Think you can get that thug into the boat? I want him."

"Sure," Kerr said. "Leave him to me."

English followed Lois into the cabin.

"I found this, Nick," she said, pointing to a square leather suitcase. "It's a tape recorder. I think Perm intended to blackmail Sherman. The tape contains all kinds of conversations between Sherman and Perm, and something that clears you. Sherman talked to me. Penn must have set the machine going. Listen to this."

She opened the case, and flicked down the switch. The two reels began to revolve.

*"Murder is an odd thing," Sherman's voice said clearly out of the machine. "Its like a snowball rolling down a hill. One murder leads to another. I wouldn't be in this jam if that cheap little chiseler hadn't tried to gyp me. I was a fool to have picked on him to work for me. Before he came, I had a good business. Now, if I'm not very careful, the bottom could drop out of it. Ifs worth a quarter of a million a year to me, and I'm not giving that up without a fight. . . .*"

They stood side by side, listening to the flat, metallic voice, and when it said, "*I arranged he should hear about his mistress and Harry Vince. I couldn't be sure he would kill them, so I did it for him. . . .*" English put his arm around Lois, and hugged her.

"That's it! That let's me out!" he said. "Now we've got him where we want him!"

"Let's go now, Nick," Lois said, switching off the machine. "I can't wait until we've given this to the police."

English was looking past her, a sudden, puzzled expression in his eyes.

"I don't remember shutting the door, do you, Lois?" he said, and walked over to the door and turned the handle. He pulled, shook the door, and then stepped back.

"That's odd. It's locked."

"Oh, Nick!" Lois said, her eyes frightened. "You don't think he's herer

"Of course not," English said, and rattled the door handle. "Hey, Kerr! Open the door. We're locked in!"

"Nick, put your hand on the wall." He could feel a faint vibration, and he nodded.

"You're right. Maybe Kerr's decided to take the yacht in."

"It isn't Kerr. It's Sherman," Lois said. "I know it is."

English went swiftly to the porthole, and looked out. He was in time to see the speedboat drifting away into the darkness. Even as he caught a glimpse of it, it vanished from sight, wallowing in the heavy swell.

"He's cut the boat adrift," he said, turning to face her. "You're right. Sherman is on board."

He went over to the door and rattled the handle again.

The vibration was stronger now, as if the engines were mounting to full speed; and when Lois looked through the porthole, she could see the water foaming against the snip's side as it forged ahead.

"He's heading out to sea. What are we going to do, Nick?"

English was examining the door.

"The damn thing opens inwards. There's not much hope of smashing the lock. This table! I could use it as a battering ram."

"That's an idea. Let's try."

Together they wrenched the table from its fastenings, and carried it over to the door.

English picked up the table and slammed it against the door, drew back, and slammed it again. One of the door panels split.

"Once again," English said. "I think it's going to work." He drew back, and then ran at the door. The corner of the table smashed through the panel, making a gaping hole. He kicked out the rest of the panel, leaned through the opening and found the key in the lock. He pushed open the door.

"Now, look, Lois, you stay here," he said, "or better still, go into the next cabin and lock yourself in. Take the recorder with you. Whatever happens, we're not going to lose that. I'm going to see what's happening."

"No, don't, Nick. Don't leave me. If anything happened to you . . ."

"I'll be careful. Now get into the other cabin and wait for me." He picked up the recorder and pushed her into the passage. "I'll be all right."

Before she could argue further, he handed her the recorder, and then went along the passage to the companionway.

He went to the stairway slowly, his ears cocked for the slightest sound, but all he could hear was the noise of the engines and the heavy thud of the sea against the yacht as she drove through the water.

When he was almost at the top of the companionway, he stopped. He listened, then went on, and very cautiously looked along the dark deck. He saw nothing. The deck was deserted, and he looked toward the bridge, but that too was deserted.

He guessed Sherman must have lashed the wheel, and was hiding somewhere, waiting for him to show himself.

Then he saw a movement in the shadows ahead of him, and he quickly ducked down so that he was no longer outlined against the white hatchway.

"Hello, English," Sherman said, from out of the shadows. "I can see you and I'm covering you with a gun."

English looked in the direction of the voice. He decided Sherman was too far away for a quick rush. He moved down a step so Sherman couldn't pick him off, and waited.

"I thought you'd walk into my trap, sooner or later," Sherman went on. "She wouldn't believe you'd come after her. I told her you would. I said that you had the mentality of a Grade B movie star."

"Where do you think you're going?" English asked. "Every Coast Guard boat on the coast is on the lookout for you."

"That, of course, is a stupid lie," Sherman returned. "In a few hours, when Kerr recovers from the clout on the head I gave him, they might look for us but, by that time, it will be too late."

"Don't be too sure," English said. "You don't imagine you can get away in this yacht, do you?"

Sherman laughed.

"No, but it'll be at the bottom of the sea by the time they come after us," he said, and came out of the shadows. He held an automatic in his hand, and it covered the companionway. 'That's where we're going, English—you and the girl and II To the bottom of the sea."

"Is that necessary?" English asked. "Surely, you don't want to join us."

"I'm going to end it," Sherman said. "I'm sick of killing people. I shouldn't have killed Gloria. The janitor saw me leave. Of course, I would have killed him, but I can't go on and on killing people. I'm sick of it! There seems no end to it. Well, I'm going to end it, and end you, too."

"And how do you propose to end it?" English asked, seeking information. He knew it was hopeless to attempt to close with Sherman. The distance between them was too great.

"I've set fire to the yacht," Sherman said. "There should be a pretty good blaze before long. You'll have the opportunity of either burning or drowning. We're about twelve miles off shore now, and we're still going. Personally, I prefer to drown."

English had heard all he wanted to know now. He slid down the stairs and landed heavily in the passage.

Lois had come along the passage and had heard what had been said. She looked at English, her face pale but her eyes unafraid.

"He's cracked," English said. "He says he's set fire to the yacht. Maybe he's lying, but if he isn't, we may have to swim for it. Can you swim, Lois?"

She smiled.

"Yes. You don't have to worry about me."

"But I do worry about you." He put his hand on her arm and looked down at her. "This is the wrong time and place, my dear, but I'd better tell you now. I'm in love with you. I guess I've been in love with you for years. It was only when I thought I was going to lose you, I realized it. Sorry, Lois, but there it is. Better late than never, I. suppose. Having got that off my chest, let's get busy. There must be some life belts somewhere down here."

She gave him a quick, searching look before going into the cabin. They found three life belts and two oilskins.

"We'll wrap the recorder in the oilskins, and then put a life belt around it," English said. "I'm not losing it unless I have to."

"I can smell smoke," Lois said.

English stepped into the passage. Smoke was drifting up through the floor boards. He returned to the cabin to help Lois tie the life belt around the recorder.

"We can't get off the boat without going up on deck," he said, "and he's guarding the head of the stairs. You wait here."

"Be careful, Nick."

He put his fingers under her chin, and kissed her.

"You bet. But we've got to get out of here."

A sudden gust of smoke swirled into the cabin, making them cough; and when he went into the narrow passage, he found it full of smoke and the heat intense.

"Come on, Lois, you can't stay here."

She joined him, and they ran along the passage to the companionway.

English hadn't yet put on his life belt. He didn't want Sherman to know they had life belts, and he put his belt on the stairs before he looked along the deck.

Cautiously, he went up the stairs and onto the deck. Still, he could see no sign of Sherman.

"Lois!" he called softly.

She joined him, and he motioned her to keep down.

"I can't see him. Let's get out of here. Give me the recorder."

"Your life belt," she said, thrusting the belt into his hands.

As he started to take it, he saw Sherman coming through the smoke. He dropped the belt, grabbed Lois by the arm and rushed her across the deck.

"In you go," he said, and lifting her, dropped her into the sea.

He ran back for the recorder and as he snatched it up, Sherman saw him.

"Don't move!" he shouted.

English dodged to the right, reached the rail and tossed the recorder into the sea. As he put his hand on the rail to vault over. Sherman shot him.

English felt something hit him violently in his side, sending a scorching pain through his body. He fell face down on the hot deck.

The deck was so hot, his soaking clothes sizzled; and as he tried to push himself to his-feet, his hands began to blister. He rolled over, frantically trying to get under the rail and into the sea.

Sherman ran over to him, caught hold of one of his ankles and dragged him back.

"You're not going to get away!" he cried, wildly. "You'll roast here with me. How do you like it, English? How do you like your first taste of hell?"

English kicked out. The heel of his shoes crashed against Sherman's knee cap, bringing him down. Sherman's gun went off, and a slug ploughed a furrow in the deck near English's head.

English rolled on Sherman, pinning him flat on the deck. Snarling with pain and fury, Sherman tried to get his gun hand up, but English caught his wrist in both hands and pressed Sherman's hand down on the metal guard that ran the length of the yacht.

Sherman screamed as the hot metal burned into his flesh. Exerting all his great strength, English kept Sherman's hand down against the metal.

Sherman slammed his free fist into English's face, but English held on until Sherman's fingers opened in agony, and the gun dropped into the sea.

He let go of Sherman's wrist, tried to get to his feet, but the pain in his side was now so intense he blacked out for a moment.

He came out of the faint, the hot deck scorching his back. Sherman was kneeling on him, his fingers digging into his throat. English caught hold of Sherman's thumbs and wrenched them back, breaking Sherman's hold. As Sherman groped for his throat again, English smashed his fist into Sherman's face, sending him sprawling on his back.

English grabbed hold of the rail and dragged himself to his feet. Before Sherman could reach him, English overbalanced and fell headfirst into the sea.

The shock of the cold water revived him, and when he broke surface, he shook the water out of his eyes and turned on his back.

The yacht was now blazing like a torch, lighting up the sea. English kicked out to send himself away from the yacht and the intense heat.

"Nick!"

A hand closed over his shoulder. He turned his head. Lois was beside him, her other hand holding on to the recorder.

"Oh, darling, are you hurt?"

"It's all right," English gasped. "It's nothing much. What happened to him?"

"I think he's still on the yacht."

English reached out and put his hand over the recorder. With its help, he kept his head above water. His legs hung like leaden weights; and if it hadn't been for the buoyancy of the recorder, he would have sunk.

"Keep near me, Lois," he said. "I'm bleeding a little."

"Get on your back," she urged. "I can hold you. Keep a grip on that case."

As he turned on his back, he saw Sherman, swimming strongly towards them. Sherman's eyes were gleaming, and his teeth showed in a vicious snarl.

"Look out!" English-panted, and pushed Lois away from him.

Sherman's hand caught hold of English's shoulder.

"We'll go down together!" he cried, shrilly. "This is the pay-off, English!"

English struck out at him, but his strength was failing. He felt Sherman's fingers shift from his shoulder to his throat.

They went down together, Sherman locking his legs around English's body, his fingers digging into English's throat.

Lois saw them go down, and she dived after them, but the buoyancy of her life belt immediately returned her to the surface.

Frantically, she wrestled with the strings to get it off, but the knots had hardened in the water.

"Nick!" she screamed, and again tried to go down, but again the buoyancy of the belt brought her to the surface.

Then suddenly there was a commotion under the water. She caught a glimpse of the two men, still locked together, as they came to the surface. She saw English's hand grope for Sherman's face, and his thumbs sink into Sherman's eyes as they went down again, the water closing over them.

She waited, her heart pounding, sick with fear for English, watching the bubbles of air as the two men fought under the water. They broke water a second time. Sherman seemed no longer to be struggling. His arms and legs were locked around English's body while English was fighting desperately to throw him off.

She swam towards them, trying to reach them before they sank again, but she was too late. They went down again as English was within a few inches of her hand.

Then, after a pause, a body came to the surface, rolled over and floated half submerged, near her. She reached it, turned it and saw with a sob of relief, English's white unconscious face.

She held him up, pushing him toward the floating recorder and propping him over it.

She was still holding him above the water when Kerr found them, fifteen minutes later, as he brought the speedboat towards the flaming wreck.

THE END
