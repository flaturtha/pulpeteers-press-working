### Chapter 5

Corinne English carried the coffeepot into the living room and set it on the table. As she sat down, she yawned and ran her fingers through her blonde hair.

The time was twenty minutes past eleven in the morning, and the bright sunshine made her feel jaded. She poured the coffee into a cup, and then, after only a momentary hesitation, she got up and went over to the liquor cabinet for a bottle of brandy.

Since Roy's death, she had been drinking heavily. The lonely house, her brooding thoughts about Roy and Mary Savitt, and her hatred of Nick English so preyed on her mind that she turned automatically to brandy to "deaden her suffering," as she put it to herself. She brought the bottle to the table, poured a liberal shot into the coffee, and sat down again. Her eyes hardened as she thought of English. She hated him as she didn't think it possible to hate anyone. His threat to hand over Roy's letters to the press filled her with vindictive fury.

She finished her coffee, got up and took a glass from the liquor cabinet and half filled it with brandy.

"May as well get soused as sit here and think about that bastard," she said aloud. "I've nothing to do until lunch time. And when lunch time comes, I shan't want any lunch. So what the hell?"

As she was about to sit down, the musical chimes at the front door sounded.

"Oh, damn," she said crossly. "That'll be Hetty."

She went across the sitting room into the lobby, and opened the front door.

A youngish man stood on the step. He raised his brown slouch hat, showing thick, flaxen hair that looked like burnished silver in the sunlight. He smiled at Corinne, his jaws moving rhythmically as he chewed, his amber-colored eyes sliding over her plump little figure like a caress.

"Mrs. English?"

"Yes, but I—I don't receive callers at this hour. Who are you?"

"My name is Roger Sherman, Mrs. English. I'm an" old friend of Roy's."

"Oh!" Corinne stepped back. "Perhaps you had better come in. The place is in a ghastly mess. My maid hasn't come yet I was just having breakfast."

Sherman stepped into the lobby, and closed the door.

"Please don't be embarrassed," he said, and gave her a charming smile. "I should have called you on the telephone first. I do hope you will forgive me."

Corinne was in a flutter. Roy had never mentioned Roger Sherman to her, but it was obvious this man was wealthy. She had caught a glimpse of a big shiny Cadillac at the door, and his clothes and manner impressed her.

"Please go into the living room. I won't be a moment," she said, and retreated hurriedly into her bedroom, shutting the door.

Sherman walked into the living room and looked around with a slight wrinkling of his nose. He saw the bottle of brandy, and the glass, and nodded to himself. He went over and stood by the electric heater, his hands in his pockets, his jaws moving slowly. He remained like that for over a quarter of an hour, his blank expression masking his impatience.

Corinne came in, still flustered. She had put on make-up, and had changed into a lilac-colored wrap which she kept for best occasions.

"I'm sorry to have kept you waiting," she said, closing the door. "But I had to make myself look a little presentable."

"Why, you look charming," Sherman said, smiling at her. "So you are Roy's wife. He often talked about you, saving how pretty you are, and now I've seen you for myself, I can endorse that."

It seemed a long time to Corinne since anyone had paid her a compliment, and for a moment she forgot how Roy had betrayed her, and the memory of their past happiness brought tears to her eyes.

"Roy never mentioned you," she said, touching her eyes with her handkerchief. "You say you were a friend of his?"

"We were very old friends. I was shocked to hear of bis death. I would have come to you sooner only I have been out of town. I can't say how sorry I am."

"Please don't talk about it," Corinne said, and sat down. "I don't think 111 ever get over the disgrace."

"You mustn't  say things like that,"  Sherman said gently.

"After all, it wasn't Roy's fault. I suppose you know that his brother was at the bottom of the whole thing?"

Corinne stiffened.

"How do you know?"

Sherman's eyes went to the bottle of brandy.

"Would it be rude of me to ask if I might have a drink? I like a drink at this time of the morning, but perhaps you wouldn't approve?"

"Oh, yes," Corinne said. "Please help yourself. I don't mind in the least."

Sherman went over to the cabinet for a brandy glass. He poured brandy into it, and then appeared to notice Corinne's empty glass for the first time.

"May I give you a drink, too, Mrs. English?"

Corinne hesitated. She didn't want this presentable young man to think that she was in the habit of drinking brandy in the morning, but she wanted a drink badly.

"Well, perhaps a small one. I'm not feeling very bright this morning."

"I'm sorry to hear that," Sherman returned, poured brandy generously into her glass and gave it to her. "I hope this won't be the last time we meet," he went on, and saluted her with his glass.

Corinne drank half the brandy while Sherman scarcely touched his.

"You were talking about Nick English," Corinne said. "How do you know he was at the bottom of Roy's death?"

"Roy told, me," Sherman said, and sat down beside Corinne.

"What did he tell you?" Corinne demanded.

"He told me about the money," Sherman said. "You know about that, of course?"

"What money?"

"Why, the twenty thousand dollars Roy meant you to have," Sherman returned, lifting his eyebrows. "Surely your attorney has given it to you?"

Corinne's big blue eyes opened wide.

"Twenty thousand dollars?" she repeated. "I don't know anything about it."

"But surely you've been left something? Forgive me for appearing curious but, after all, I was Roy's best friend, and I feel that I should see that his wife has been properly provided for."

"Oh, thank you," Corinne said, nearly dissolving into tears. "You don't know how lonely I've been. Of course, Sam Crail has been kind, but he is very busy. After all, it's not as if he was a friend. He was only Roy's attorney."

"He's Nick English's attorney, too," Sherman said.

Corinne stiffened.

"He is? I didn't know that But it doesn't matter, does it? He wouldn't tell that man anything, would he?"

"He's on English's pay roll," Sherman said. "It's no secret. He does exactly what English tells him."

"Oh!" Corinne's face flushed. "What am I going to do? I wouldn't have had him in the house if I had known."

"May I ask what you've got to live on?" Sherman said, leaning forward and looking at her intently.

"Roy left an annuity. I'm to have two hundred dollars a week for life," Corinne said.

"And nothing has been said about the twenty thousand?"

"No. This is the first time I have heard of it. What twenty thousand?"

"You know about- Mary Savitt, I suppose?"

Corinne looked away.

"Yes, I know about her. How Roy could have done such a thing . . ."

"Some men get carried away by unscrupulous women," Sherman said, shaking his head. "And she was unscrupulous, Mrs. English. It wouldn't have lasted."

Corinne put her hand on his.

"Thank you for saying that. That's what I've been telling myself. Roy couldn't have gone off and left me. I know he would have come back."

"He didn't forget you. He provided for you. He told me so. He brought off a deal which netted him twenty thousand. He intended to give you the money when he went off with Mary Savitt."

"Roy made twenty thousand," Corinne said, startled. "Why, I can't believe it. Roy never made any money, ever."

"Strictly speaking, it was rather a shady deal," Sherman said. "Apparently, Nick English was handling it. Roy happened to call on the same client on another matter, and the client confused Roy with Nick. Roy didn't enlighten him, and pulled off the deal. Nick English was so angry, he called in the police. They were on their way when Roy got into a panic and shot himself."

"Oh!" Corinne said, and leaned back, closing her eyes. "You mean that that man was going to have his own brother arrested?"

"I'm afraid so. Roy had put the money in a safe deposit and had given Crail the key. Grail was to give you the money. As you haven't gotten it, it would seem pretty obvious that English had instructed Crail to hand the money to him."

Corinne sat bolt upright, her eyes furious.

"D'you mean he's stolen the money from me?"

Sherman lifted his shoulders.

"It looks like it, but neither you nor I have any proof that the money even exists."

Corinne took a long pull at her glass. The brandy she had already drunk before Sherman arrived was beginning to have an effect on her, and she felt a little dizzy, and very reckless.

"Well, he's not going to get away with it. I'll fix that louse." She jumped to her feet. "I'll make him suffer for this!"

"I can understand your feelings," Sherman said, watching her narrowly, "but how do you propose to do it? He is an extremely powerful and influential individual."

"I'll think of some way," Corinne said, and moving a little unsteadily across the room, she refilled her glass, slopping the brandy on the carpet as she did so.

"Perhaps I could help you," Sherman said, getting to his feet.

She turned and leaned against the liquor cabinet, staring at him.

"Can you?" she asked. "How?"

"It wouldn't be possible to get the money out of him, but if you want to make him suffer . . ."

"That's what I do want! Do you know how I can do it?"

"Yes, but it'll depend on you whether you succeed or not You know Julie Clair?"

"I don't know her," Corinne said, "but I know of her. She's bis mistress, isn't she?"

"And English is crazy about her. I happen to know that she is having an affair with his general manager, a fellow named Harry Vince."

Corinne stood very still, looking at Sherman, her eyes gleaming.

"Are you sure?" she said. "Are you absolutely sure?"

"She goes to Vince's apartment whenever English has a business date. I've seen her go there."

"This is what I've been waiting for," Corinne said, and moved unsteadily back to the settee. "Oh! Now I'll make him suffer. If only he could find them together!"

"That could be arranged," Sherman said. "He happens to be dining tonight with Senator Beaumont at the Silver Tower. She's bound to go to her lover. Why don't you go along and tell him?"

"Will you come with me?" Corinne asked, her face lighting up with a cruel little smile.

Sherman shook his head.

"That's not possible. I have an engagement for tonight. English will show up about eight-thirty. If you get there by nine, it will be time enough."

'Til be there," she said, clenching her fists. "Ill make a scene he and his swank friends won't forget in a hurry."

Sherman smiled.

"I thought you'd make good use of the information."

She suddenly looked at him curiously.

"Why did you tell me? Have you something to settle with his as well?"

"If I had," Sherman said smoothly, "I would do my own dirty work. I happen to be angry about the way he has treated you. I felt I had to give you a weapon, and I've given it to you."

Corinne smiled at him.

"I'm grateful." She crossed her legs, letting the wrap fall away a little, to show her knees. "I can't say how grateful lam."

"There's just one thing I'd ask you to do," Sherman said, his eyes straying to her knees. "When you have told him, will you telephone me?"

"Why, of course."

He took out a card and gave it to her.

"You'll find me at this number after nine o'clock. Will you telephone me immediately after you have spoken to him? I want to know what he does. It's important. Can I rely on you?"

"Of course," she repeated, taking the card. "I'll call you just after nine."

"Thank you." He looked around for his hat, and suddenly she couldn't bear the thought of his leaving. Not since she had first met Roy had a man had such a strong attraction for her. "Well, I'll be running along," he went on. "May I come and see you again?"

"Yes, I wish you would. You can't imagine how lonely I get Roy and I were always around together when he wasn't at work, and I miss him terribly."

The amber-colored eyes dwelt on her face speculatively.

Then I'll fix it soon," Sherman said and moved to the door.



II

Lois Marshall was just finishing dictating a batch of cables to her stenographer when Ed Leon pushed open the office door and came in.

He lifted his hat.

"Mr. English around?"

"Yes, he's expecting you," Lois told him. "Would you sit down for a moment? Mr. Crail's not here yet."

Leon lowered his long frame into an easy chair, and groped for a pack of Camels. In a few moments, the door opened and Crail came in. His freshly shaven face was thoughtful as he nodded to Lois, and waved a plump hand at Leon.

"You look as if you'd had a pretty good breakfast," Leon said enviously. "Or is that bulge under your vest just part of your scenery?"

Crail ran his hand over his paunch, and smiled smugly.

"It's part of my goodwill," he returned. "If I had a frame like yours, I'd go out of business. No one trusts a thin man these days." He looked over at Lois. "Mr. English ready for me?"

"I think so," Lois said, picking up the telephone, "Mr. Crail and Mr. Leon are waiting, Mr. English," she said, and nodded

at the two men. "Will you go in, please."

Leon levered himself out of the chair and followed Crail into English's office.

English was sitting at his desk. Harry Vince was crossing the room to the door, a pile of papers in his hand. Harry nodded to Crail, looked sharply at Leon, and went out.

"Who's that guy?" Leon asked, dropping into a chair.

"Don't you know Harry?" English said. "He's my general manager, and a damned fine one at that."

"What's new, Nick?" Crail asked, sitting down. "I can't stay long. I'm in court at ten-thirty."

"I've found the guy who murdered Roy," English said quietly.

"You have?" Crail sat up. "Well, for God's sake! That's fast work."

English nodded over to Leon.

"He may not look it, but he happens to be a fast worker."

"Sherman?" Leon asked.

"Yes."

English went on to tell them of the conversation he had had with Sherman the previous night.

"Three murders?" Crail said, his eyes opening. "He admitted them?"

"He didn't deny them," English returned.

"Well, I'll be damned! I'd like to see the D.A.'s face when you tell him," Crail said, and rubbed his hands together. "He hasn't even connected the three killings with the same man."

"I'm not telling the D.A.," English said, paused to light his cigar, and as he waved out the match, he went on, "It's up to him to find the killer. I'm not anxious to tell the world my brother was a blackmailer. I've given Sherman until Saturday to get out of town."

Crail looked quickly at Leon who stared back at him with an expression of complete indifference.

"You can't do it, Nick," Crail said sharply. "It'll make you an accessory after the fact. Damn it! It would make me an. accessory, too."

"That's one of the drawbacks of working for me," English said, and smiled.

"Do you think Sherman would go?" Leon broke in.

"He'd be a fool if he didn't. I hold all the cards. He didnt strike me as a fool. But I want you to take care of him, Ed. Sit on his tail. Don't lose him for a second. I want him under your eye day and night until he leaves town on Saturday."

Leon nodded.

"You don't mean to tell me you are going to let him get away with three murders?" Crail said, horrified.

"He's already got away with them," English returned. "I haven't any evidence that'd stand up in court. If he double-crosses me, I'll manufacture some evidence, but not until."

"What do you mean—manufacture evidence?" Crail asked, his eyebrows climbing.

"I'll explain that when and if I have to," English said. "If this fellow double-crosses me, he's going to the chair, and you and I are putting him in the chair."

"That'll be something for you to dream about," Leon said to Crail, and grinned. "What do you make of Sherman?" he went on to English.

"I'd say he was crazy," English said soberly. "I mean that He's about as dangerous as a rattlesnake. There's a chance he'll try to pull a fast one. He might even arrange for me to be bis fourth victim. I've put into writing the whole of our conversation, and I have it here." He slid an envelope across the desk. "I want you to take care of this, Sam. If anything should happen to me, give it to Morilli."

Crail looked startled.

"You're not serious, are you?"

"I'm very serious, Sam. I've told Chuck to carry a gun, and not let me out of his sight for a moment, and I want you to swing into action any moment, Sam. If Sherman tries anything funny, I mean to send him to the chair."

Crail shook his head as he got to his feet.

"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. I've got to get going, Nick. See you later." Crail nodded to Leon and left the office.

English glanced at his watch. "Well, I've got work to do, Ed. Will you get after Sherman? From now on until Saturday, I don't want him out of your sight. It's important. Don't let him give you the slip."

"Ill take care of him," Leon said. "I know what I meant to tell you—I tracked down those mike wires in Roy's office. They lead into an office on the same floor, owned by a silhouette artist. A woman named Gloria Windsor."

"Think she's one of the gang?" English asked, not particularly interested.

"Must be. It's my guess she fingered Roy. She must have heard Roy and the Savitt girl planning to pull out. Those two must have made their plans in the office, not knowing the mike was in the chimney to pick up every word they said. You can bet that's how Sherman found out that Roy was cheating on him."

"Well, it's done now," English said, shrugging. "I'm content to get rid of Sherman. When he's gone, the rest of them will be like a body without a head."

Leon got to his feet.

"Let's hope so. I'll keep tabs on Sherman. If he looks like starting anything, I'll call you."

"Thanks, Ed. So long for now."

After Leon had gone, English immersed himself in the routine paper work that came to his desk every day. He worked quickly and methodically, his mind concentrated on the worK before him.

Lois found him hard at it a few minutes to lunch time. She came in and put another pile of papers in his In-tray. He glanced up and smiled at her.

"Did you remember to book a table at the Silver Tower for tonight?" he asked.

"Yes, for eight-thirty."

"Might have known you wouldn't forget. I don't believe you've ever forgotten anything to do with my business since we hooked up together. That's quite a record."

"That's what you pay me for," Lois said lightly.

"I guess so," English said, and frowned, "but I bet not many secretaries give the service that you do. Let's see—you've been with me for five years, haven't you?"

Lois smiled.

"Yes. It'll be five years exactly on Saturday."

"Is that right? How did you remember that?"

"I have a good memory for dates."

"Saturday, eh?" English said. "Well, damn it! We should celebrate. We've come pretty far in five years, haven't we? Tell you what! I'll take you out to dinner on Saturday. We'll celebrate the firm's fifth birthday. What do you say?"

A faint flush came to Lois' face. She hesitated, then said quickly, "I don't think I can manage Saturday night, Mr. English. I have a date."

English studied her, noticing her flush deepen.

"Okay. Lois, if you can't put your boy friend off, you can't. Well, maybe some other night. I'll see what I can fix."

"It's nothing to do with a boy friend," Lois exclaimed with a vehemence that startled English. "I just happen to be busy that night," and she went out of the office, closing the door sharply behind her.

English frowned down at his blotter, puzzled.

"Well, that takes care of that," he said to himself. "And Julie says the girl's in love with me. Well, what do you know? Won't even accept an invitation to dinner. Is that what Julie calls love?"

Some ten minutes later, he put down his pen and walked over to where his hat and coat were hanging. He was struggling into his coat when a tap came on the door, and Julie came in.

"Why, hello, Julie," he said, straightening his coat. "What brings you here?"

Julie reached up and gave him a quick kiss.

"I want some money," she said. "I'm lunching with Joyce Gibbons, and I've come out without my purse."

"I wish I could join you," English said regretfully, taking out his billfold. "Will fifty hold you?"

"That's plenty, darling. And you can drive me downtown, if you like."

"Where are you lunching?" English asked, reaching for his hat.

"Marcel's."

"Right. It's on my way. Come on, then. Let's get going."

They walked into the outer office. Harry Vince came in at this moment. He gave Julia a quick, uneasy look, then stood aside.

"Hello, Harry," Julie said gaily. "I know what I want you to do for me."

"Yes, Julie?" Harry said, stiffly.

His tone made Lois look up sharply. She was sitting at her desk by the window, unnoticed by either Julie or Harry.

"I want two more tickets for the show. It's for tonight," Julie said. "Can you get them for me?"

"Why, yes," Harry said, changing color.

"Hey!" English said, with a grin. "Don't ruin me, Julie. I can't give too many tickets away."

"Now, don't be a tightwad," Julie said, linking her arm in his. "You know people expect me to give them tickets for all your shows."

"See what you can do for her, Harry," English said. "What she says goes, it seems."

"Yes, Mr. English," Harry said huskily.

"Aren't you dining with that dreary old Senator tonight?". Julie said as she led English across the office. "What time are you meeting him?"

"Eight-thirty," English said. "I won't be seeing you tonight, Julie."

He followed her into the passage.

Harry stood motionless, looking after them. There was an expression on his face that startled Lois. She watched him, and when he went abruptly out of the office, she felt a little chill of apprehension run through her.



Ill

As English handed his hat and coat to the check-girl at the Silver Tower restaurant and was about to move to the washroom, he saw Senator Beaumont come in.

"Hello, there, Senator," he said.

Senator Henry Beaumont was sixty-five years old—small, wiry and thin. He was a man of insatiable ambition. When English first met him, Beaumont had been Commissioner of Highways, attached to the Democratic machine ruling Chicago at that time. Beaumont had introduced him to his circle of wealthy businessmen. It was through Beaumont's introductions that English financed his gyroscope compass.

When English finally settled in Essex City, he remembered Beaumont and wrote to him, offering to finance him if he cared to run for the post of county judge. Beaumont jumped at the offer, and with English's money behind him, he was elected.

English was quick to realize that as his business expanded and his kingdom grew, it was essential to have a powerful friend in the political machine. Although Beaumont was no ball of fire, he was at least sharply aware of his debt to English, and was willing to pull strings when English wanted them pulled.

The next move, English had decided, was to get Beaumont elected Senator. The opposition was stiff, but again with English's money and coupled with his ruthless determination, Beaumont became Senator. Now, he was to come up for reelection in another six months' time, and English knew Beaumont was uneasy as to what the results would be.

"How are you, Nick?" Beaumont asked, shaking hands.

"I'm fine. I was just going to have a wash. Coming?"

"May as well," Beaumont returned, and together they walked into the ornate washroom.

While English washed his hands, Beaumont lit a cigar and stood near him, scowling.

"You shouldn't have called off the Committee meeting, Nick," he said. lThe Commission doesn't like being treated like that. Rees was particularly angry."

"You know why I called it off?" English said, drying his hands.

"Well, I can guess. This stink about Roy. But you shouldn't have just called it off the way you did."

English tossed the towel into the basket, and took the Senator's arm.

"Have a highball and relax," he said, leading the Senator into the bar. "Rees may be Chairman of the Commission but he'll stand for everything I dish out, and you know it."

"He won't. He said it was time someone clamped down on you, and he's going to do it."

English passed a highball to Beaumont, and ordered a martini for himself.

"And how does he intend to clamp down on me?" he asked, smiling.

"He didn't say, but I've heard he's pressing the D.A. to investigate the blackmail rumors about Roy."

English shrugged.

"There's nothing to investigate. Let him go ahead if he wants to, but if he starts anything he can't prove, I'm going to sue the coat off his back!"

Beaumont nodded.

"I told him so," he said, a satisfied expression coming into his eyes. "He didn't like it. All the same, Nick, if there's any truth in it, you've got to be damned careful."

"Don't talk crap!" English said roughly. "There's nothing for me to do—nothing at all. He's got to prove that Roy was a blackmailer, and he can't do it."

"How about that girl? Roy's secretary?"

"She's been taken care of. The press didn't hook her to Roy, nor did the D.A. You've nothing to worry about, so relax, can't you."

"It's all very well for you to talk," Beaumont said crossly, "but I've my position to think of. Those sonsofbitches are gunning for me as well as you."

"So long as I'm here, you've nothing to worry about," English said.

'Talk of the devil," Beaumont muttered. "Here's Rees now."

English glanced up.

Standing in the doorway, was a squat, hard-faced man in his late sixties, talking to a pretty vivacious-looking girl who was wearing a silver blue mutation mink in a cape stole over a black evening gown.

"I wonder if he bought her that cape or if she hired it," English said out of the corner of his mouth. "That's Lola Vegas. She used to dance at the Golden Apple before I threw her out. She went for anything in trousers—even the waiters."

"Keep your voice down, for God's sake!" Beaumont mumbled. "Rees is poison to you and me."

"Who are you kidding?" English said, and laughed.

Rees came up to the bar and sat away from English. He nodded stiffly to Beaumont and then to English.

English nodded back, waved a careless hand at Lola who glared at him before turning her back.

"When she tried to make the bellhop, I thought it was time she went," English said. "As you can see, she still nurses a grudge."

Beaumont hurriedly switched the conversation to the coming election, but Nick wasn't listening. He had seen Corinne English, standing in the doorway. She was wearing a white evening dress that had seen better days. Her hair was untidy, and her face was flushed. Already people were staring at her.

"Here's Roy's wife," English said. "This is the last time I come to this restaurant. Every crum in town seems to be patronizing it."

Beaumont looked across the room, his small, wiry frame stiffening.

"Well! She looks drunk," he said, clutching hold of the arms of his chair.

"She is drunk," English said.

He pushed back his chair and stood up as Corinne made unsteady progress across the bar towards him.

"Hello, Corinne," he said, "If you're alone, perhaps you'll join me."

"Hello, louse," she said shrilly. "I'd rather be in a snake pit than with you."

The hum of conversation in the bar petered out, and all eyes turned to English in a silence that seemed to pile up around him like a snowdrift. He continued to smile.

"If that's the way you feel, Corinne," he said quietly, "then I'm sorry I asked," and turned back to his table.

"Don't run away," Corinne said shrilly. "I've got a lot to say to you," and she grabbed hold of his arm, pulling him around.

A hard-faced man in a tuxedo appeared suddenly behind the bar. He looked quickly at English, then said something to the barman.

English made no attempt to shake free from Corinne's grip.

"Your whore's in bed with Harry Vince," Corinne said, raising her voice. "They've been lovers for months, you poor, stupid sucker! Every time you have a business date, she sneaks off to his apartment. She's in bed with him right now!"

People were leaning forward, staring and not missing a word. The hard-faced man came out from behind the bar and walked smoothly up to English.

"Shall I get her out, Mr. English?" he asked without moving his lips.

"It's all right," English said gently, his face expressionless. "I'll do it Come on, Corinne. I'll see you home. You can tell me all about it as we go."

Corinne stepped back, her face going white. She expected some reaction from English but his calmness cut the ground from under her feet.

"Don't you believe me," she screamed. "I tell you Julie Clair's in bed with your manager!"

"Well, why shouldn't she be?" English said smiling. "What business is it of yours or mine, Corinne?"

Rees half started out of his chair, thought better of it and sat down again.

Lola said in a clear, hard voice, "My God! How absolutely disgusting."

"Come on, Corinne, let's go home," English said, taking her arm.

"Don't you mind?" Corinne wailed, trying to pull away from a grip that looked gentle but that held her like a vice.

"Why, no, I don't think I do," English said soothingly as if talking to a child. "You know as well as I do, it's all nonsense. Come along. People are staring at you, my dear."

Corinne began to cry. What had seemed such a spectacular opportunity for revenge was petering out like a damp firecracker. By bis quiet, kindly behavior, she could feel that English had the crowd with him. They looked on her as some souse making a scene.

She made one more desperate attempt to save the situation.

"It's true!" she screamed, trying to break free. "And you killed your brother! You robbed me of twenty thousand dollars. Let go of me!"

A man laughed suddenly, and she knew with a sickening sense of frustration that she had muffed the whole plan.

English continued to walk her from the bar into the empty lobby. The hard-faced man who had followed them, said "Shall I give her a little tap, Mr. English?"

"Why, no, Louis," English said, "but I'd be glad if you could see her home. Get a taxi, will you?"

"Okay, Mr. English."

Corinne leaned against English and continued to cry. He put his arm around her.

"Take it easy," he said. "You get off home and have a sleep, I know how you're feeling."

"You don't," Corinne moaned. "I wanted to hurt you. I wanted to make you suffer as you have made me suffer."

"How do you know you haven't?" English said, and tilted up her chin. "Is it true?"

She couldn't meet his eyes.

"Is it true?" he repeated.

She nodded.

"Well, that's all right. Then we're quits. I shouldn't have threatened to hand Roy's letters to the press. I wouldn't have done it, of course, but I shouldn't have used such a threat against you."

Louis came up.

"The taxi's here, Mr. English. Ill take care of her."

English watched Louis lead Corinne across the sidewalk to the waiting taxi. His face was a little pale now, but still expressionless.

Beaumont joined him.

"My God, Nick! The press will get this. Why the hell didn't you stop her talking? Rees was drinking it in. He'll spread it all over the town."

"Shut up!" English said harshly. "I played it the right way. Do you think that anyone will believe that drunken little act?"

Beaumont hesitated.

"Is it true?"

English turned and looked at him. His light-blue eyes were chips of ice.

"What the hell is it to do with you or anyone else if it is true or not?"

Beaumont recognized the danger signals.

"That's right It's none of my business," he said hurriedly. "Well, maybe we'd better go into dinner."

"I'm not staying. I have something to do," English said. "I'll see you tomorrow, Senator. Excuse me now."

He walked over to the cloakroom, got his hat and coat from the check girl, and walked across the lobby to the revolving door.

At ten minutes to eight o'clock, Roger Sherman turned out the lights in his bedroom and moved over to the double windows that overlooked the street.

He was dressed to go out. His brown slouch hat was pulled down low over his face, and the collar of his coat was turned up.

He lifted the shade a few inches away from the window and peered down into the street. Rain, beating against the glass, made it hard to see clearly. Sherman's eyes searched the opposite doorways. He spotted the figure of a man, standing in a porch out of the rain, the red tip of a cigarette pin pointing his face, half concealed under a pulled down hat brim.

He crossed the room, opened the door that led into the kitchen and went to the window without turning on the light. Again, he lifted the shade and looked down into the back street that ran the length of the rear of his apartment block. He finally spotted another man standing under a tree, and nodded.

It was now obvious to him that English was making certain that he would be kept informed of his movements. Since noon, Sherman had known that he was being tailed, and tailed by experts.

These two men knew their business, and they didn't seem to care if he was aware or not that they were tailing him. They were intent only on not letting him give them the slip.

They were now waiting for him to make a move, guarding the only two exits of the block, and it was essential to his plan that he wasn't followed this evening.

He returned to the living room and turned on the radio. Then he took from his pocket a pair of thin silk gloves—so thin, that when he put them on, they seemed to form a second skin on his hands.

He went over to his desk, opened a top drawer and took out a .38 Colt automatic. He released the clip, checked the bullets replaced the clip and jacked a bullet into the breech. He clicked down the safety catch and slipped the gun into his overcoat pocket.

Leaving the lights on in the living room, knowing the watcher below had a clear view of the lighted windows, Sherman walked softly to the front door, opened it a few inches, and peered into the empty passage.

Sherman stepped out, closed the front door, and walked swiftly and silently to the staircase. He went up, two steps at a time, until he reached the next landing. He paused for several seconds while he leaned over the banister rail, listening.

He went along the passage to a window, pushed it open and looked out into the dark night. Below was a sheer drop of a hundred feet or more. The window looked out onto the roofs of houses and business premises, dwarfed by the vast block. He glanced back down the passage, then put one foot up on the window sill, and holding on to the window frame, he stood up, half in and half out of the window.

He reached up and his fingers closed around a narrow horizontal pipe that ran the length of the building. Holding on with one hand, he reached in and closed the window.

Rain beat down on him as he braced himself against the face of the building. His left hand went up and caught hold of the pipe.

The pipe was wet, and felt slippery—something he hadn't bargained for, and he cursed the rain. But this was the only way he could leave the block if he was to avoid the two men waiting for him below, and he didn't hesitate.

He shifted his hands until his body was at an almost forty-five degree sideways slant, his hands on the pipe, his feet on the window sill. Then he swung his feet clear of the sill and hung in space by his hands.

With the agility of a gymnast, he swung himself along the pipe, hand over hand, until he reached a drainpipe that went down to a foot-wide ledge about twenty feet below his dangling feet.

He had one dangerous moment, as he was changing his hold from the horizontal pipe to the vertical one.

His right hand failed to get a grip and he swung outwards, hanging on only by his left hand.

He looked down into the dark depths below, his jaws moving rhythmically as he chewed, completely unafraid and unruffled. His right hand clawed out for the drainpipe, got a grip, and he pulled himself against it, digging his knees into the sides of the pipe while he slowly released his grip on the horizontal pipe with his left hand.

He remained like that, clinging on with hands, knees and toes until he had properly adjusted his balance, then he began to let himself down, inch by inch, until he reached the ledge.

He stood against the face of the building while he recovered his breath.

Thirty feet below him was a flat roof, an ugly projection that covered the kitchens of the restaurant of the apartment block.

He rested for a minute or so, then gripped the vertical pipe again and lowered himself to the flat roof. Bending low, to avoid being seen against the skyline, he walked silently to the edge of the roof to the fire escape ladder that would take him to the ground. He went down the ladder swiftly.

He found himself in a dark alley, lined with garbage cans— the tradesman's entrance to the apartment block. At the far end of the alley was the main street, and he walked quickly and silently towards it. When he reached the end of the alley, he stopped and peered cautiously into the street.

Some thirty yards to his right was the main entrance to the apartment block. He looked across the street. The watcher was still in the porch, sheltering from the rain, his eyes on the revolving doors opposite.

Sherman pulled his hat brim lower over his face, and moved out of the mouth of the alley, keeping in the alley, keeping in the shadows, his eyes fixed on the man in the porch.

He began to walk sideways away from the watcher, but the the man in the porch didn't look his way, and as Sherman turned the corner into the street, he gave a little nod of satisfaction.

He walked in the rain for some minutes until he was well clear of the block, then he signaled to a passing taxi.

'Take me to Fifth and Tenth Street," he said, got into the cab and slammed the door.

Julie lifted her head from the pillow and peered at the clock. The hands showed three minutes after nine o'clock.

"It's not time yet, surely?" Harry Vince said, pulling her close to him.

"No. Another half hour. Dear Harry," Julie sighed, her hand touching his bare chest. "I wish I didn't have to leave you. Time goes so quickly."

"Nick will be tied up for hours yet," Harry said. "Can't you give up the club tonight, Julie? Can't you give it up altogether? I want you all the time."

"And I want you," Julie said, a little untruthfully. She lifted her face so he could kiss her, and for some moments they gave themselves up to their love. Then Julie said suddenly, "Better not, darling. No, really, Harry, I must be going in a few minutes."

"You're going to be late, Julie," he said. "I don't care, and you're not going to care."

"I mustn't be," Julie said, her mind only half made up.

"You're going to be."

"Then quickly, darling," she said, and she kissed him so hard that he tasted salty blood on her mouth crushed against his. "Oh, darling," she said, and caught her breath. "Oh, darling, darling, darling!"

Time stood still for them. Only their quick breathing and her sharp little cry of pleasure disturbed the silence.

Then suddenly he felt her fingers stiffen into little hooks, digging into his shoulders, and her body was like a bow that has been bent by its string.

"What was that?" she said sharply, her mouth against his ear. Her hands pushed him away, and she half sat up, staring into the firelit darkness.

"What's the matter?" he asked, lying back on the pillow and frowning at her.

"I heard something," she said, and he saw how pale she had gone as the light from the fire lit up her tense face.

A cold chill snaked down his spine, and he, too, sat up to listen.

"There's someone in the other room," Julie whispered.

"Can't be," he said, feeling suddenly sick. "The door's locked. You're imagining things."

"No. Someone's there," Julie said, and her groping hand caught his. "I know there is."

Harry tried to listen, but all he could hear was the steady hammering of his heart, and the sound of blood pounding through his arteries.

"There can't be anyone," he said hoarsely. "You're scaring me out of my wits, Julie."

"Go and see," she said. "Fm sure I heard something."

He hesitated, not believing her, but wondering if English could have got in. Suppose he had? Suppose that when he opened the bedroom door, he found English out there.

"Harry!" Julie said sharply. "Go and see!"

He pushed back the sheet and swung his legs off the bed, his hand grabbing up his dressing gown.

"You're imagining it," he said. "There's no possible way for anyone to get in."

Then he stiffened into a rigid, horrified stillness, feeling the hair on the nape of his neck bristle.

Across the silence of the room came a faint, scraping noise, then very slowly the bedroom door began to open.

"Oh, Harry!" Julie breathed, her fingers digging into his arm.

Roger Sherman came in. In his right hand, he held the Colt automatic. Dark patches from the rain stained his raincoat. Water dripped from the rim of his hat. He stepped into the room, his jaws moving slowly as he chewed, his amber eyes reflecting the bright flame from the fire.

The automatic swung up and covered Harry.

"Don't move," Sherman said quietly, "either of you."

He came further into the room and shut the door.

The relief to Harry that it wasn't English, was overpowering.

"Get out of here!" he said, his voice still unsteady, his eyes on the gun.

Sherman moved over to an armchair by the fire, and sat down. His deliberate, quiet movements, horrified Julie.

"Stay where you are," he said, crossing one leg over the other. The automatic pointed between Julie and Harry. "Don't do anything stupid or I'll have to kill you."

"Who—who are you?" Harry said, suddenly realizing this man couldn't be a burglar—he was too well dressed to be that.

"My name is Roger Sherman," Sherman returned mildly. "Not that that will tell you anything." His amber eyes moved from Harry to Julie who was holding the sheet over her breasts, staring at him with wide, frightened eyes. "Hello, Julie. You don't know me, but I know you. I've been watching you two for some time. It seems to me that you're taking unnecessary risks coming here. After all, you were paying Roy English to keep his mouth shut, weren't you?"

"How do you know that?" Harry said, his face paling.

"My dear man, I was English's boss."

"So it's blackmail'. All right. How much?"

Sherman smiled.

"This time it's not money I want. I'm using you two to bait a trap."

Harry felt Julie stiffen. He half turned, taking her hand.

"What do you mean?"

"I'm waiting for Mr. English," Sherman said, and smiled. He looked at Julie. "By now, he should have heard what you two are up to. I imagine he'll come here as fast as a car can bring him."

"Now, look," Harry said, feverishly. "I don't care what it costs—I'll pay to get out of this. How much?"

"It's not a matter of money . . ." Sherman said softly.

"But this won't get English out of your way," Harry said desperately. "It'll make him all the more determined to crack down on you. All right, I admit it, it'll hit him hard, but you don't know him as I do. He'll hit back."

Sherman lifted the Colt in his silk clad hand. "This is his gun. I stole it from his apartment this afternoon. He's going to be arrested for murder—two murders, in fact."

Harry stiffened.

"What do you mean?"

"It's obvious, isn't it? When I hear his car arrive, I'm going to shoot you both. Who's going to prove he didn't do it?"

Julie caught her breath sharply.

"He's bluffing, darling," Harry said. "He wouldn't dare."

She was looking at Sherman. The expressionless eyes terrified her.

"He's going to do it," she said, through dry lips.

"Of course I am," Sherman said mildly. "You two have had your fun, and now you're going to pay for it"

"You won't be able to get away!" Harry exclaimed. "You'll be caught."

Sherman laughed.

"This window overlooks the river. I shall go that way. I'm a good swimmer."

"You can't do it!" Harry said, realizing that Sherman wasn't bluffing. "Let her go," he went on, huskily. "Don't touch her. One murder's enough."

"Sorry I can't oblige," Sherman returned. "You must see that I can't afford to let her live after I have shot you. She would give me away."

"She wouldn't," Harry said. "She'd promise not to."

"Sorry," Sherman repeated. "Besides, a double killing is much more dramatic. English might get off if he just killed you, but the jury wouldn't like him killing Julie." He moved back to the chair and sat down again.

Harry decided that he was dealing with a lunatic. Somehow, he had to divert Sherman's attention, and then close with him. He judged the distance between them. He was badly placed, as he was sitting on the side of the bed away from Sherman. Eight to nine feet separated them.

Julie said, "I'll give you all the money I have if you'll stop this. I can raise twenty thousand. If you give me time, I can get more."

Sherman shook his head.

"Save your breath," he said. "I'm not interested in money." He glanced at his watch, and Harry's hand reached behind him and gripped the pillow.

Julie saw the move. She was breathing quickly, her face white and drawn. She sensed Harry was going to do something.

"I—I think I'm going to faint," she gasped, closing her eyes, and she reached out as if to steady herself and her hand pushed over the night table which crashed to the floor.

Sherman's eyes went from Harry to the overturned table. Harry flung the pillow, threw himself off the bed as the pillow hit Sherman in the chest, smothering the gun.

Harry, white-faced, his eyes staring, sprang forward, propelling his body across the nine foot space toward Sherman.

Sherman half started up, throwing the pillow from him. Harry saw that he couldn't reach Sherman before Sherman shot him, but he kept on, his mouth dry, his heart hammering, trying to close the space between himself and Sherman.

There was a crash of gunfire. The bullet got Harry just below the knee, bringing him down. His hands caught Sherman's belt, gripped, dragging Sherman forward.

Sherman hit Harry a glancing blow with the gun barrel on his temple and kicked him away. He was completely unruffled, and his jaws moved rhythmically as he looked quickly at Julie who crouched petrified on the bed, the sheet fallen from her, her hands covering her breasts.

Harry rolled away, blood running down his leg. He began to crawl toward Sherman, his lips drawn off his teeth in a snarl.

Sherman backed away, smiling.

"You fool!" he said, softly.

Harry kept on. The pain in his shattered knee filled him with a murderous rage. He wasn't frightened any more. All he wanted to do now was to get his hands on Sherman.

Sherman raised the Colt, and aimed carefully. Harry was only a few feet from him. He looked up at the little black sight of the gun pointing at him and at the cold amber eyes squinting along the barrel.

Julie screamed wildly.

"Don't! No—don't!"

The bullet took Harry squarely between the eyes. The force of the blow threw him backwards and he rolled over on bis side, his fingers opening and closing convulsively, his muscles twitching, blood smothering his face.

"A little premature, I'm afraid," Sherman said, frowning. "Well, it can't be helped."

He heard a car door slam, and he smiled.

"Here he is," he said, and moved quickly to the window. He pulled aside the curtains, opened the window, and glanced out.

"Go to him, Julie," he said softly, pointing to the door. "Let him in."

Julie didn't move. Her eyes turned from Harry's body to Sherman. She scarcely seemed to breathe.

The front door creaked as English threw his weight against it.

Sherman raised the Colt as Julie's hand closed over the key in the lock. The sight of the gun aimed at a point in the exact center of her shoulders.

Something seemed to warn her that he was going to shoot, and she looked back over her shoulder.

Her terrified scream blended with the crash of gunfire. A small blue-black hole appeared between her shoulder blades. She was flung against the door, and her knees sagged.

Sherman shot her again. The bullet got her above her right hip. Her body arched in agony, her hands clawed at the door, then her knees hinged and she fell face down, her arms and legs sprawling.

Unruffled, Sherman tossed the gun onto the floor near where she lay, turned and went swiftly back into the bedroom, across to the window.

He stepped up on the sill as he heard the front door crash open. Still unruffled, he paused long enough to draw the curtains, then he got out on to the sill, closed the window, straightened and dived without hesitation into the dark river flowing below him.
