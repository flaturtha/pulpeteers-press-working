### Chapter 3

Julie had long ago learned never to keep English wait-ing, so she was dressed and ready to leave when he telephoned to tell her their movie date was off.

When he hung up, she stood staring at her reflection in the mirror above the mantel. She told herself that she was looking her best, and the green scarf she had knotted at her throat, set off her eyes and her copper-colored hair with even more effect than she had imagined.

English had said that he would have dinner with her at the club at nine o'clock. She looked at her watch. It was now fifteen minutes past six. She had nearly three hours to wait. She dialed English's office. Lois answered, and Julie's mouth tightened. She disliked Lois intensely. Anyone could see that Lois was in love with English, except English himself, but then he would never notice a thing like that. The way Lois allowed English to make her his slave infuriated Julie. Besides, Julie knew Lois also disliked her. She was sure that Lois considered she wasn't good enough for English; and, whenever they met, Lois always seemed able to make Julie feel uncomfortable.

"Oh, Lois, this is Julie," Julie said brightly. "Is Harry there? I wanted some tickets for the show."

"Yes, he's here," Lois returned, her voice cold. "Hold on a moment, Miss Clair."

It was always "Miss Clair," although Julie had repeatedly asked Lois to call her by her first name.

There was a click on the line, and Harry's voice said "Hello, Julie. I was just going. Anything I can do?"

"I want two tickets for the show on Saturday, Harry," Julie said. "I was going to ask Nick to bring them, but our date's off. He won't be free until nine o'clock, and I'm meeting these people before then. Can you leave them at Nick's club, and I'll pick them up?"

"Of course. I'll be glad to. I'm on my way home now."

"Thanks, Harry," Julie said, and hung up.

Moving quickly, she picked up her handbag and gloves, and left the apartment. She rode down in the elevator, and asked the night porter to get her a taxi. While she waited, she lit a cigarette, and was annoyed to see that her hands were shaking.

"Where to, madam," the night porter asked, coming into the lobby.

"The Athletic Club."

The taxi made fast time through the evening traffic; and as the driver was about to turn into Western Avenue, Julie leaned forward, and said, "I've changed my mind. Drive me to Fifth and Tenth Street, please."

"Okay, miss," the driver said, and looked over his shoulder at her, grinning. "My old man always said it's because dames change their minds so often, they've got cleaner ones than us men."

"He's probably right," Julie said, and laughed.

After ten minutes' fast driving, the driver slowed down and pulled up.

"Here we are, miss."

Julie paid him, thanked him, and set off briskly along a quiet, dimly lit street that eventually led to the river. Every so often, she glanced over her shoulder, but the street was deserted, and she saw no one. Suddenly she slowed her pace, stopped and turned.

She looked quickly to right and left, and then up at the dark buildings opposite. Satisfied that no one was watching her, she went down a narrow, dimly lit alley that led to the waterfront.

A thin, white mist was coming off the river; and as she moved along in the dark shadows, a tug boat's siren hooted dismally from the other side of the river.

Again she paused. Again she looked right and left, then she stepped into the doorway of a tall, narrow building, pushed the door and stepped into a dark lobby. She moved without hesitation through the darkness as if she had been here so often she knew exactly where to go.

She heard a door open near her.

"Julie?"

"Yes."

She stepped into a dark room, and the door closed behind her. Then the light sprang up, and she turned, smiling, as Harry Vince caught her in his arms.

"What a bit of luck, darling," he said. "I was all set for a dull evening. I thought he was taking you to the movies."

She put her arms around his neck, and pressed her face against his.

"Sam turned up at the last moment," she said. "Oh, Harry, it seems such a long time. Kiss me."

Harry kissed her, holding her to him while his heart hammered against his side.

"We have such a little time, darling," she said pulling back and looking up at him. "Don't let's talk now. Don't let's waste a minute."

The clock on the mantel struck eight, and Julie sat up.

"Don't move, darling," Harry said out of the darkness, and his arm went around her. "You have an hour yet."

"No, only half an hour. I mustn't keep him waiting."

"Julie, we can't go on and on like this," Harry said, his face against hers. "Can't you talk to him? Can't you tell him you want to break off?"

He felt her stiffen, and there was a note of alarm in her voice when she said, "Nick would never give me up. You know that. Besides, how would we live? Don't let's go over this again. You know that we never get anywhere."

"But if he ever found out," Harry said, voicing a fear that had been haunting him for weeks, "he'd kill me. He wouldn't stop to think. He'd kill us first and let Crail fix it afterwards."

"Oh, darling, you're talking nonsense," Julie said, touching his face. "Nick wouldn't do a thing like that. He's far too wrapped up in his own career to risk ruining it. Why, he told me he wants the hospital named after him. Of course, he wouldn't."

Harry wasn't convinced.

"I'm not so sure. If he caught me . . ."

"But he won't—not now."

Harry half sat up.

"What do you mean—not now?"

"Now Roy's dead."

"What's Roy got to do with us?"

She hesitated, then speaking rapidly as if to force out the words, she said, "Roy knew. He'd been blackmailing me for the past six months."

Harry stiffened, and cold fear clutched at his heart He realized then how frightened he was of English.

He got off the bed and slipped on a dressing gown, then he turned on a lamp.

"Roy knew about us?" he repeated, and Julie saw that he had gone white.

She turned on her side, her hands covering her breasts.

"Yes, he knew."

Harry felt sick.

"When did it happen? You say he was blackmailing you?"

She nodded as she lit a cigarette.

"It's been hell, Harry. I thought I'd go out of my mind. One day, Roy came to see me. It must have been six or seven months ago. He said, 'You're going to come to my office every Friday with two hundred dollars, Julie. I can't make you come, of course, but I can tell Nick that you're having an affair with Harry Vince. Are you going to pay or am I going to tell Nick?' That's all there was to it. I was so frightened I didn't even ask him how he had found out. I said that I would pay, and every Friday since then I've paid."

"The louse!" Harry said furiously, clenching his fists. "So it is true. They're saying he was a blackmailer. The dirty, rotten louse!"

"You can't imagine how relieved I was when Nick told me that he had shot himself," Julie said. "It's been a nightmare these past months."

"Do you think he told Corinne?" Harry asked. "Suppose she goes to Nick?"

"Why should he tell her?" Julie said a little impatiently. "It wasn't anything to be proud of. Besides Corinne would have told Nick before now if Roy had told her. I'm sure only he and that girl of his knew, and they're both dead."

Harry began to pace up and down.

"Julie, can't we go away together?" he asked abruptly. "Must we go on taking chances? It's not as if he's married to you."

She paused, with one stocking on and the other in her hand.

"What would happen to us? Nick's so powerful. I'd never get another engagement, and you'd never get another job. He would see to that. He'd find us and he'd hound us for life. Be patient, Harry. Let's be thankful we can see each other like this from time to time. Something may turn up. Let's not take any chances."

"But this is dangerous," Harry said. "We're cheating him now, but if we went away together, he couldn't accuse us of that."

"He'd find us, Harry. He would never let me go."

"He's not God," Harry said. "I know he's powerful, but, damn it, he couldn't stop me earning a living. That's nonsense, Julie."

Julie slipped into her dress, put on her shoes and crossed over to the dressing table. She sat down and began to make up her face.

"Say something, Julie," Harry said anxiously. "Don't you see that this is even more dangerous than going away?"

She turned and faced him.

"All right, Harry. I'll tell you the truth. For weeks now I knew that we should have told Nick and gone away together, but I can't face it. I can't give up all the things that mean so much to me. I don't suppose you have ever thought what it means to me to have Nick behind me. If it wasn't for Nick, I wouldn't be singing at the best night club in town. I wouldn't have that lovely penthouse or all the clothes I've got. I wouldn't have accounts at all the big stores. If I walked out on Nick, I would walk into different life, and I wouldn't like it."

Harry winced, and sat down. He stared into the fire, his right fist grinding into the palm of his left hand.

"I see," he said in a flat, tired voice. "No, I hadn't thought of it quite like that, Julie."

"I want my cake and I want to eat it," Julie said, not looking at him. "I love you, Harry, more than any other man on earth. Sometimes I wish that I'd never met you. It would have saved so much pain and worry. But I did meet you, and I did fall in love with you, so there it is. You've got to take me as I am, or leave me. Now you know the truth, Harry, you'd better tell me whether you want to see me again. I wouldn't blame you if you now hate the sight of me, as I hate the sight of myself. I'm the worst kind of a bitch but I can't help it. I would do anything for you, except give up the life Nick gives me. I don't suppose you believe that, but I would. I would even keep away from you if you wanted me to, and that would be the hardest thing of all I'd do for you."

Harry got up and went over to her; bending, he lifted her face, and kissed her.

"I'm not going to give you up, Julie. You mean too much to me for that. All right, darling, we'll go" on as we've gone on. Perhaps one day something will turn up, and we can get out of this mess."

Julie got to her feet and clung to him.

"Darling Harry, I love you so, and I'll try to make you happy. Be patient. I'm sure it will come right in the end. Now, darling, I must go. I'll come again as soon as I can. Get my coat, will you? I'm going to be late if I don't hurry."

A few minutes later, Julie moved quietly to the mouth of the alley and looked quickly to the right and left The street was deserted. Moving forward briskly, she went in search of a taxi.

In a dark doorway, a youngish man in a brown suit and a brown slouch hat, stood with his back against a wall, watching her, his jaws moving slowly as he chewed. He remained in the shadows until she was out of sight, then he came out of the doorway and walked quickly towards the river, his lips pursed in a soundless whistle.



II

Ed Leon took possession of the Alert Agency two days after English had called him from Chicago.

Leon was tall and rangy, all legs and arms, and he had a deceptive appearance that led most people to assume that he was a harmless nitwit. He had a pleasant sun-tanned face, and at first glance you might have mistaken him for a not-too-prosperous farmer up for the day to see the sights of the city. He wore his clothes as if he had slept in them, not for one night but for many nights, and he had a habit of wearing an old tattered slouch hat far at the back of his head. No one would have believed that he was one of the smartest private eyes in the country.

As he wandered around the small, shabby office that had once belonged to Roy English, Leon wasn't pleased that he had allowed himself to be talked into taking this assignment The pay was good, but he didn't relish spending much time in these two rooms after the luxury of his air-conditioned office in Chicago.

He pulled at his long nose thoughtfully as he wandered around the room, his face tense, his eyes missing nothing. He spent two hours going through the files, examining drawers and cupboards, with the methodical care he had developed after years of experience that had taught him that nothing was unimportant, that there was a reason for everything; and that if you kept looking, that sooner or later, you would find something to interest you.

It was not until he had examined the fireplace that he made any worth-while discovery. He found a small object lodged in the chimney that made him raise his heavy eyebrows and take from his pocket a pencil-thin flashlight. It was a small microphone. The wires attached to it went through a crack in the chimney and into the outer office. He strolled into the outer office, and after a lengthy search, found the wires again neatly hidden between the floor boards. He traced them across the room to the door leading into the passage. From the look of the microphone, it had been installed for some time.

Leon wondered if the microphone was still alive, and if someone would be interested in listening to his conversations. At a more convenient time—when the building was closed for the night—he decided that he would make an attempt to trace the wires further.

English had told him that the janitor, Tom Calhoun, seemed cooperative, and Leon thought it might be an idea to go down and talk to him before settling down to a day's work.

He left the office, locking the door behind him, and took the elevator to the basement.

He found Tom Calhoun in the boiler room industriously carving a model boat from a chunk of soft wood, with the aid of a murderous looking pocket knife. He eyed Leon with mild interest and gave him a brief nod.

"Morning," he said. "Anything I can do for you?"

Leon hooked a chair towards him and folded his long length into it.

"I got an ulcer," he said. "At noon every day I give it a feed of whiskey. The trouble is I don't approve of drinking alone. Once a guy gets into the habit of secret drinking, he might just as well step into his box and let them screw him down. I thought maybe you might care to join me, but if you're a non-drinking man, just say the word and 111 go elsewhere."

Calhoun laid down the boat and sat forward.

"You've come to the right man, mister, but I wouldn't have thought whiskey would have done an ulcer much good."

Leon produced a half-pint flask of Johnny Walker and waved it in the air.

"A guy has got to show his independence," he said. "If I gave my ulcer what was good for it, it'd stay with me the rest of my days. The whiskey's good for me so I drink it. Got two glasses?"

Calhoun produced two paper cups from a shelf.

"Best I can do," he said apologetically after blowing the dust from them. He watched Leon pour two stiff shots, and eagerly took one of the cups and sniffed at it. "Good whiskey, mister. Here's to you," and he took a long pull, sighed, smacked his lips, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and set the cup down.

Leon scarcely tasted his, but leaned forward to refill Calhoun's cup.

"I'm your new tenant," he said. "The name's Ed Leon. I've taken over the Alert Agency."

Calhoun looked surprised.

"Glad to know you. I'm Tom Calhoun. Alert Agency, huh? That's fast work."

"My mother was a fast woman," Leon said lightly. "It runs in the family." He frowned, shook his head, went on, "Business seems a little flat this morning."

"It'll pick up," Calhoun said encouragingly and took another drink. "I reckon that guy English knew what he was doing. He kept mighty busy. Why he shot himself beats me. Of course, that shooting might slow things down for you, but not for long."

Leon took out two cigarettes, rolled one across the table and lit the other.

"I was beginning to wonder if I'd been sold a dog. You really think that's a good business?"

"I'm sure of it," Calhoun said. "It stands to reason. Look at the people who went up to see him—as many as thirty people on some days."

"Well, well," Leon went on and lifted his feet on to the table. "So it looks like I've come into a good business. Who were these people who came to see English?"

Calhoun lifted his big, lumpy shoulders.

"I wouldn't know. Some of them would come every week. Some of them were trash, but most of them looked as if they had a sack of dough."

"Were you in the building when he knocked himself off?" Leon asked casually and leaned forward to fill Calhoun's paper cup again.

"Sure," Calhoun said. "Go easy on that stuff, mister."

"Don't tell me that a big boy like you can't drink a little Scotch," Leon said. "They tell me that he shot himself between nine and ten-thirty. Did anyone call on him around that time?"

Three people went up to the sixth floor. But I wouldn't know if they called on him. Why?"

"I'm always asking questions," Leon said, and closed his eyes. "I like the sound of my own voice. You should see the way the broads fall over when I whisper in their ears." He opened his eyes and stared at Calhoun. "Who were those three?"

'Two men and a girl," Calhoun told him. "I took them up to the sixth floor myself. I'd seen the girl before but not the two men."

"Who else is on the sixth floor?"

"Well, there's the Associated News Service. Maybe you've already heard their teletypers. Hell of a racket they make. Then there's your office, and then there's Miss Windsor."

"What's she do?"

"She's what they call a silhouette artist," Calhoun told him. "She cuts out your silhouette in paper, mounts and frames it. What else she does up there, I don't ask, but I do know she has only men clients."

Leon perked up, his eyes showing interest.

"Like that, is it?" he said. "And my next door neighbor. Well, well, maybe I'd better go along and let her look at my silhouette. She might even show me hers."

"She's a nice dish," Calhoun said, "but it's strictly for cash. No—I prefer to waste my money on horses, but it takes all types to make a world."

"Don't go philosophical on me," Leon said. "Let's get back to these two guys and a girl. They could have called on either Miss Windsor, this news service, or on English—that right?"

"The girl went to see English," Calhoun said. "I've seen her a number of times before."

"What's she look like?"

"She had sort of light brown hair, a good figure, and she was pretty enough to be in the movies."

"What a description! Do you realize that there are two million dames within a radius of thirty miles in this goddam city who look just like that? How was she dressed?"

"She was pretty smart," Calhoun said, screwing up his eyes as if he was trying to create a picture of the girl in his mind. "She wore a black coat with white wide lapels, black skirt, black and white gloves, and a black and white skull cap affair for a hat. And she had one of those charm bracelets. You know the ones—a gold chain with little charms hanging from it."

Leon nodded approvingly.

"Now you're talking. That's fine. You'll make a detective yet. Now about the two guys?"

"One of them was just a punk—a kid about eighteen. He had on a leather jacket and flannel trousers. He had a parcel under his arm. I have an idea that he was going to the news service, but the other guy was in the money. He was a young fella, around twenty-seven or eight, in a brown suit and a brown slouch hat I noticed that he wore his handkerchief in his sleeve. He was chewing gum. When a guy can afford clothes like that, he shouldn't chew gum."

Leon lowered his feet to the floor.

"Just to get the record straight, when did these people arrive —who came first?"

"The girl. Then the guy in the leather jacket. Then the guy in the brown suit."

"What time did the girl arrive?"

"It was nine-fifty," Calhoun said. "I know because she asked me the time."

"And the other two?"

"The fella in the leather jacket was waiting to go up as I came down from taking the girl up. The guy in the brown suit came along about fifteen minutes later."

"Did you see any of them leave?"

Calhoun shook his head.

"I take them up, but I don't reckon to bring them down. That's what they've got legs for."

"I guess that's right," Leon said, and stood up. "The self-service elevator wasn't working?"

"I lock it at seven o'clock. I like to know who comes into the building after that time."

Leon nodded again.

"Well, that's very interesting. You'd better keep what's left of that half-pint. If I took it up with me I'd be laying myself open to temptation. I guess I'd better go along and call on Miss Windsor. Nothing like being neighborly. Who knows? She might be lonely."

"That dame's never lonely," Calhoun said, "But watch it It's strictly for cash."

Leon propelled his lanky frame to the door.

"Not for me, brother," he said, pausing at the door. "I'm going to explain to her the principles of lend-lease."



III

As Leon stepped out of the elevator, he saw a short, shabby-looking man in a wrinkled overcoat and a dusty gray hat, knocking on his office door.

The man looked quickly over his shoulder as he heard the grill close. He was a man of about sixty, gray faced, tired-looking with a scrubby, gray moustache. He looked nervously at Leon as he wandered along the passage, then he rapped on the door again, and turned the knob. Finding the door locked, he backed away, obviously surprised.

"Hello, paL" Leon said, coming up to him. "Looking for me?"

The man gave Leon a quick look, and backed against the banister rail.

"No, thank you," he said. "I wanted to see Mr. English. Never mind. I'll come again. He doesn't seem to be in."

"Maybe I can do something," Leon said. "I'm looking after Mr. English's affairs at the moment." He took out his door key and pushed it into the lock. "Come on in."

"It's all right," the man said, and his tired, bloodshot eyes quivered. "I wanted to see Mr. English. It's a personal matter. Thanks all the same," and turning, he walked hurriedly towards the head of the stairs.

Leon started after him, then stopped as he remembered the hidden microphone in his office. That room wasn't the place to persuade someone to talk. He turned and ran for the elevator, stepped into it, and set the cage down to the ground floor.

As he entered the lobby, he could hear the shabby man running down the stairs. He had one more flight to go before he reached the lobby. Moving quickly, Leon went into the street and ducked into a near-by doorway.

He watched the shabby man come out into the spring sunshine and set off along the street. He moved slowly, his feet dragging, and he walked for some time toward Twenty-second Street.

Leon moved along behind him, taking care to keep out of sight. He saw the man pause outside a restaurant, hesitate, then walk in.

As Leon passed the restaurant, he glanced in. There were only three or four people in the place, and he spotted the man sitting at a table at the far end of the room.

Leon waited a few seconds, then pushed open the door and walked in.

The man glanced up, but didn't seem to recognize Leon. He was stirring a cup of coffee aimlessly, his face frowning and his eyes worried.

Leon inspected the other people in the place. There were two men at a table by the door; a girl reading a paper-backed book at a table near the counter, and a man hidden behind an open newspaper opposite where the shabby man was sitting.

Leon sat down at the table, and the man looked up and stared at him. Recognition swam into his eyes, and his face went a grayish white. He started to get up, then dropped back into his chair, nearly upsetting his coffee as he did so.

"Keep your shirt on," Leon said, and smiled. "I'm not going to bite you." He turned and waved to the girl behind the counter. "Bring me a cup of coffee, honey."

The shabby man ran his tongue over his dry lips.

"See here, mister," he said with feeble fierceness, "you've no right to follow me. Mr. English and me have a private deal on. It's none of your business."

"It is my business," Leon said. "I've taken over the agency. English isn't with us any more."

The man stared at him.

"I wasn't told," he muttered. "I've got nothing to say to you."

"I'm telling you," Leon said, and stirred his coffee. "I'm in charge now. Come on, what's it all about?"

"You mean you're taking the money in the future?"

"Don't I keep telling you?" Leon said roughly. "What do you want me to do—set it to music and sing it to you?"

"Where's Mr. English then?"

"He's gone to a warmer climate. Are you going to deal with me or do you want me to get tough?"

"That's all right," the shabby man said hurriedly. "I just didn't know." He took out a soiled envelope and slid it across the table. "Here it is. Now I've got to go."

"Sit still!" Leon snapped, and picked up the envelope. On it was scribbled: "*From Joe Hennessey. \$10.*"

"Are you Hennessey?" he asked.

The man nodded.

Leon ripped open the envelope and took out two five-dollar bills. He studied Hennessey for a moment.

"What's this for?" he asked at last.

"What do you mean? It's all right, isn't it?"

"Maybe. I wouldn't know. What are you giving me this for?"

Hennessey's face began to glisten with sweat.

"Give me back that money!" he said, keeping his voice low. "I knew you were a phoney. Give it back to mel"

Leon slid the money across the table.

"Relax. I don't want it," he said soothingly. "I just want to know why you're parting with this dough. From the look of you, you can't afford to give away ten bucks."

"I can't!" Hennessey said bitterly. He stared at the two bills lying before him, not touching them. "I'm not going to talk to you! I don't know who you are." He began to push back his chair.

"Take it easy," Leon said, and flicked one of his cards on to the table. "That's who I am, and I can help you if you'll let me."

"A copper!" Hennessey said when he had looked at the card. His eyes went dark with alarm. "There's nothing you can do for me, mister."

"Sit still!" Leon said, and leaning forward, went on, "English is dead. He shot himself three nights ago. Don't you read the newspapers?"

Hennessey stiffened, his fists clenched.

"He's dead, all right," Leon said. "Now, listen to me: I'm investigating his death. You can help me. Why are you paying him  money?"

Hennessey hesitated, then shook his head.

"It's nothing to do with you, mister," he said. "The less said about it, the better. I think I'll be getting along now."

"Wait a minute," Leon said, his voice hardening. "Do you want me to take you down to the station? You could be held as a material witness. You'd better talk, and talk fast. English was murdered!"

Hennessey went white again.

"You said he shot himself."

"Now I'm telling you he was murdered. Why were you paying him money?"

"He was blackmailing me," Hennessey blurted out. "I've paid him ten dollars a week for eleven months, and if he hadn't died, I would have gone on paying him."

"What had he got on you?"

Hennessey hesitated, then he said. "Something I did years ago—something bad. He was going to tell my wife."

"Were all the other people calling on English paying blackmail money?" Leon asked.

"I guess so. I never talked to any of them, but I've seen the same faces every time I went to that office."

"How did English contact you?" Leon said.

"A fella came to my shop. He told me he knew about what Td done, and if I didn't pay ten dollars a week he would tell my wife. He told me to take the money every Thursday to the Alert Agency, and that's what I did."

"It wasn't English?"

Hennessey shook his head.

"No, but English took the money. This other fella was the outside man. I reckon English was the boss."

"What was this man like?"

"A big, tough-looking guy. He had a scar from his right ear to his mouth; looked like an old razor wound, and he had a cast in his left eye. He was big and powerful, not the kind of fella you'd argue with."

"Let's have your address," Leon said. "I might want to talk to you again."

"I'm at 27 Eastern Street."

"Okay, pal, now relax. There's nothing for you to worry about. English is dead. Go home and forget about him and blackmail. Forget it ever happened."

"You mean I don't have to pay any more money?"

Leon reached out and patted his arm.

"No. If the tough guy shows up, stall him and tell me. Ill take care of him, and 111 see you're in the clear."

Hennessey got slowly to his feet He looked suddenly five years younger.

"You don't know what this means to me," he said, a break in his voice. "Ten dollars was skinning me."

"Consider it taken care of," Leon said. "I'm here to help you if you want help, and listen, I don't promise anything, but I may be able to get some of your money back for you. Ten dollars a week for eleven months. Was that it?"

Hennessey stared at him as if he couldn't believe his ears.

"Yes, that's right," he said hoarsely.

"Don't count on it," Leon said, "but 111 see what I can.do."

He got up, paid for the two coffees and went out the door with Hennessey.

The man who had been sitting at the table opposite Hennessey's and who had been hidden behind a newspaper, lowered the paper and looked after Leon, his jaws moving rhythmically as he chewed. He put the paper aside, and got up, crossed over to the counter and gave the girl a couple of nickels.

She smiled archly at him, impressed by his faultlessly fitting brown suit and the silk handkerchief he wore tucked in his sleeve.

He looked at her, and her smile faltered. She had never seen such eyes. They were amber-colored with small pupils, and the whites were the color of blue-white porcelain. They were as compelling and as expressionless as the eyes of an owl, and looking into them she felt a little chill run up her spine.

He watched her reaction with cat-like interest, then turned and moved briskly to the door.

He stood looking after Leon and Hennessey as they walked down the street together. Then he ran across the road to where a dusty, shabby Packard was parked. He got into the car, started the engine and waited.

He watched Hennessey and Leon pause for a moment at the corner. Leon shook hands with Hennessey, and then went off uptown. Hennessey walked away in the opposite direction.

The man in the brown suit shifted into gear and sent the car rolling slowly after Hennessey.

Hennessey walked with a light step. He was anxious to get back to his shop.

The man in the brown suit drove along near the curb, his amber-colored eyes fixed on Hennessey's distant back. He drove patiently, keeping out of the way of the faster traffic, and every now and then he looked searchingly at the numbers of the stores as if he were hunting for a particular number to explain his slow crawl.

At the end of the street, there was a narrow alley. It was an alley dwarfed by high warehouses, and even in daylight, it was shadowy and dark. Few people used it, but to save his legs, Hennessey always went home that way.

As Hennessey began to walk down the long, narrow alley, he heard a car behind him, and looking round sharply, he saw the Packard.

No cars ever came this way. The alley was far too narrow. There was only a foot clearance each side of the car's fender. Hennessey realized that the car was coming after him, and fear clutched at his heart, for a moment paralyzing him.

He stood in the middle of the alley, hesitating, looking frantically to right and left. Ahead of him, some two hundred feet, was an archway leading to a courtyard. The archway was too narrow for a car. He began to run toward the archway, his old blue overcoat slapping, and his breath rattling at the back of his throat. He was too old and stiff to make much headway, but he did his best.

The man in the brown suit pushed down on the gas pedal and sent the Packard surging forward. For a few seconds, the running, stumbling man and the swiftly moving car seemed to remain equi-distant. Hennessey looked over his shoulder. He saw the car rushing down on him. He cried out in fear and desperation as he made a frantic effort to reach the archway. He was within ten yards of it when the car hit him.

It hit him the way a charging bull hits a matador. It threw him high into the air and forward, so that he came down on his back within a few yards of the car.

The man in the brown suit slammed on his brakes and stopped within a yard of Hennessey who turned his head to stare at the car, seeing only the two wheels and the dusty hood. A thin trickle of blood ran out of his mouth, and he felt a terrible pain tearing at his chest.

The man in the brown suit glanced into the driving mirror. He could see the dim length of the alley stretching out behind him. It was empty and silent. He shifted gears and reversed the car, stopping it when it was some twenty to thirty feet from where Hennessey was lying, then he shifted into second, let in the clutch and sent the car forward slowly, leaning out of the window so that he could see what he was doing. Hennessey screamed wildly as the car came toward him.

The man in the brown suit moved the steering wheel a trifle. He leaned far out of the car. Hennessey looked up into the big amber-colored eyes that were as indifferent to him and as expressionless as the headlamps of the car. The left front wheel went over Hennessey's upturned face. Keeping his course, the man in the brown suit felt the rear wheel lift and thud down, and he gave a pleased little nod. He slightly increased his speed, reached the end of the alley, swung into the main street and headed uptown.



IV

Nick English paced the floor of his office, his hands clasped behind his back, his chin down, his face hard and frowning.

The time was six minutes after seven. Everyone, including Lois, had gone home, and only he and Ed Leon remained in the office.

He listened to Leon's report with growing alarm, although he didn't reveal the fact to Leon.

Leon lolled in an armchair, his long fingers laced around one knee, his hat rested on the back of his head, and he talked in a low voice, marshaling his facts and bringing them out clearly.

"Well, I guess that's about all," he wound up. "I don't know how you feel about Hennessey, Nick, but I gave him a hint that he might get some of his money back. He's been bled for close to five hundred dollars."

"I'll write a check," English said, and moved over to the 52



desk. "I just can't believe it! Organized blackmail! Who's this

man with the scar?"	\-'

"I don't know, but I'll find out if you want me to. From what Hennessey said, he was just Roy's stooge."

"I don't believe that either. Roy hadn't it in him to organize a racket like this. If anyone was the stooge, he was the one."

Leon didn't say anything.

"If this gets out, Ed, I'm sunk," English went on. "But these people should be found and paid back. This man with the scar should be put out of business. Maybe he was the one who shot Roy."

"I've checked on that angle," Leon said. "Three people went up to the sixth floor around the time Roy was supposed to have shot himself. Two men and a girl. The girl was the only one that Calhoun was sure had gone to see English. The other two called on the News Service Agency. I checked on them."

English frowned.

"Funny time to call, wasn't it?"

"That's what I thought, but the manager of the News Service said that they never close and people come in at all hours. Still, this guy might be worth checking on. He might have gone first to this news service and then along to shoot Roy. It would have given him an alibi if Calhoun had reported his presence to Morilli."

"Is it likely a killer would have used the elevator?" English said. "I doubt if he or the girl shot Roy. The killer wouldn't want to be seen. He would slip into the building and walk upstairs."

"Maybe," Leon said, "but on the other hand he might be a smooth operator, and anticipate that that was what people would think. He might figure that he would be unlikely to be suspected if he used the elevator and let Calhoun have a good look at him so long as he could prove he had been to the news service."

English nodded.

"Yes, that's smart thinking. You'd better see if you can find out something about him. Have you got a description?"

"Yep, and a good one. He's around twenty-seven or \-eight, and he wore a brown suit and a brown hat. He carries a silk handkerchief tucked up his sleeve, and he chews gum. But for all that, it won't be easy to find him."

"Think so?" English said. "I think I can give you his name and tell you where he lives right now. If I'm not mistaken, his name's Roger Sherman and he lives in Crown Court"

Leon stared at him.

"A friend of yours?"

English shook his head.

"No, I haven't even spoken to him, but I've seen him often enough. He has an apartment on the same floor as mine. The description fits him like a glove."

"What does he do for a living?"

"I don't know. Nothing as far as I can see. He's a dilettante. He's interested in art and music. You'll always find him at previews of fashionable galleries, and he has a box for all important concerts. I might have a talk with him myself. I can't imagine that he even knew Roy—let alone wanted to shoot him, but he might know something. I think you can leave him to me."

Leon nodded, slowly got to his feet and stretched.

"Well, I guess I'll get along. I want to find somewhere to sleep. The hotel I'm staying at gives me the creeps. The room I've got is so small, I have to use a folding toothbrush."

"What about the girl who called on Roy? You haven't told me about her yet," English said.

"According to Calhoun, she was good-looking enough to be in the movies," Leon said, stubbing out bis cigarette. "He said she was wearing a black and white small cap, a black suit with wide, white lapels, black and white gloves, and a charm bracelet."

English paused in his pacing and looked sharply at Leon.

"A charm bracelet?"

"That's right—a gold chain with little charms hanging from it."

"Well, I'll be doubled damned!" English said under his breath, and he ran his fingers through his hair.

"Don't say you know her too?"

"I don't know. I might. I'll let you know, Ed. Here, wait a minute, let me write a check for Hennessey. Cash it yourself and give him the money, and don't let him know where it comes from."

"I'll do just that thing."

Leon waited until English had written the check, slipped it into his pocket and made for the door.

"I guess I'll go back to the office and see if I can find out where those microphone wires lead to," he said. "If I make a startling discovery, I'll phone you. Where will you be?"

"Phone me at my apartment after midnight," English said, glancing at his watch. "Or maybe you'd better leave it until tomorrow morning."

"Ill do that," Leon said. "So long for now."

When he had gone, English turned off the lights, put on his overcoat and went down to where Chuck was waiting with the car.

"Miss Clair's apartment," English said curtly.

"Want the evening paper, boss?" Chuck asked, offering it

"Thanks," English returned, got into the car and turned on the reading lamp. He read through the paper as Chuck drove towards Riverside Drive. A small item caught his eye. He read it, frowning. Read it again, then said, "Get me to a telephone quickly, Chuck."

"One just ahead," Chuck said, swung over to the curb, and pulled up outside a drugstore.

English got out of the car and hurried across the sidewalk to a row of phone booths. He called the Alert Agency.

Leon answered.

"I've only just this second got in," he said, startled to hear English's voice so soon.

"That old man you were telling me about—was his name Joe Hennessey?"

"That's right. Why?"

"27 Eastern Street?"

"Yep."

"He's dead. It's in the paper. He was killed by a hit-and-run artist in an alley that's barred to traffic."

"For crying out loud!"

"Listen, Ed, I don't like the sound of this. It may be a coincidence but I don't think so. It seems to me that you two were seen together, and someone decided that Hennessey talked too much. Check into this business."

"Okay, I'll do that right away," Leon said. "Where can I call you if anything goes wrong?"

"I'll be with Miss Clair," English said. He gave Leon Julie's number, and hung up.

Ten minutes later he was letting himself into Julie's apartment He stood in the lobby, frowning.

"Julie?"

There was no answer, and taking off his hat and coat, he went into the living room. He crossed over to the bedroom, pushed out the door and turned on the lights.

He stood looking around the room, then walked across to the big built-in wardrobe, opened the double doors and glanced in. Among the many dresses, suits and coats hanging in an orderly line, he spotted the black suit with the wide white lapels. Above it, on a shelf was a pair of black and white gloves, and a small black and white hat.

He closed the doors, stroked his jaw thoughtfully and returned to the sitting room. He stirred the fire, went over to the liquor cabinet and poured himself a rye. Then he sat down before the fire, lit a cigarette and waited, his eyes brooding and cold.

Some ten minutes later, he heard Julie come in.

"Oh, Nick!" she said as she opened the sitting room door. "Have you been waiting long? I had a rehearsal, and there was some dope who couldn't get anything right. I'm sorry I'm late."

English got up and kissed her.

"That's all right. How are you, Julie? You're looking pretty good."

"I'm fine, but tired," Julie said, taking off her coat and sinking into an armchair. "I'm dying for a drink. Would you get me a martini?"

He began to mix the martini, shooting a searching glance at her from time to time. He thought she looked tired, and the usual sparkle in her eyes was missing.

"What's been happening to you?" she asked, leaning back and closing her eyes. "Have you had a good day?"

"Oh, all right," English said, and came over and gave her the martini. "I hope that's not too dry."

"It's perfect," Julie said, drank half of the martini, sighed and put down the glass. "What are you doing tonight?"

"I'm afraid I have a date in about an hour," English said. "Something important. Sorry, Julie."

"Oh, well, never mind. I don't have to be at the club until ten-thirty. I'll take a bath and a snooze. I don't feel like having dinner. I'll have something when I get back."

English moved slowly over to the fire.

"Julie, why did you go and see Roy the night he died?" he asked quietly.

He saw her stiffen and go white. She looked at him, her eyes opening wide, and it startled him to see the utter fear in her eyes. "Now, look, Julie," he went on, "you mustn't ever be frightened of me. I know you went there, and I want to know why, but that doesn't mean you have to be frightened."

"No, I—I suppose not," Julie said huskily, and made an effort to control herself. How much did he know? she asked herself, her mind cold with panic. Did he know about Harry? Was this only a shot in the dark? "You frightened me, Nick. I didn't think anyone knew about that."

He smiled.

"No one does except me. Was Roy blackmailing you?"

For a moment, Julie thought she was going to faint.

"I found out this afternoon that Roy had been blackmailing a number of people," English went on. "You were seen going to the sixth floor, and I recognized the description of that suit. I wondered if you, too, were paying Roy money."

Was that all he knew? she wondered, her tongue touching her dry lips.

"Yes, he was blackmailing me," she said, and her mind darted about trying to think of a reason that he would believe.

"For God's sake!" English exclaimed. "Why didn't you tell me? I would have broken his neck!"

"I didn't want to tell you. I was too ashamed of myself."

"You needn't have told me why he was blackmailing you. I don't want you to tell me now. All I'm interested in is the fact that he was blackmailing you."

Julie went limp. He didn't know! The relief was so great, she wanted to cry.

"He's been blackmailing me for the past six months," she said. "I had to go to his office and pay him two hundred dollars every week."

"You should have told me," English said, his face hard. "The little rat! I knew he was a weakling and a louse, but I never realized he had sunk as low as that. Julie, for God's sake, don't hide things like that from me again. I could have fixed Roy in a moment."

"I couldn't tell you," Julie said. "But I want to tell you now."

She realized she had to tell him some story. If she didn't, sooner or later he would become suspicious of her. He might even have her watched. She wasn't deceiving herself that his present sympathetic attitude would last. She knew him too well for that. She remembered sharing a room with a girl years ago in Boston. She remembered what had happened to the girl, and unable to think of a convincing story, she decided to borrow from the girl's experience.

"You don't have to tell me anything," English said, and came over and sat on the arm of her chair. He put his arm around her shoulders. "Is there anything I can do to help?"

"Not now. It's past history," Julie said. "It was when I was in Boston—years ago. I was only seventeen, and I was hard up. I got an audition. It came out of the blue just when I thought I would have to give up and go home. I had nothing decent to wear. I knew if I went as I was, I wouldn't get the job. The woman who kept the boarding house always kept money in the house. I stole it. I thought I would be able to get it back before she found out, but she caught me in the act She sent for the police, and I was given a week in jaiL"

English patted her shoulder.

"You needn't have told me that, Julie. So what? Most of us have done something at some time or the other that could have landed us in jail if we were caught. You were unlucky! Do you mean to tell me that Roy was blackmailing you for that?"

"He threatened to tell the papers. I would have lost my job, and then they would have got at you through me, Nick."

English's eyes hardened.

"I guess that's right. Does anyone else know about this?"

She shook her head.

"Then we'll forget it. How much did you pay Roy in all?"

"I don't want to discuss that part of it," Julie said quickly.

"Nonsense! I intend to return the money to you. How much was it?"

"Please, Nick, I don't want you to do that"

"What was it—five thousand?"

"Yes, about that, but I won't take it. I mean that. It's nothing to do with you. I've paid, and I've forgotten about it."

"Well see," English said and stood up. "Julie, when you went up there, was Roy alive?"

She nodded.

"Yes, he was alive."

"You realize, don't you, that a few minutes after you had gone, he died?"

Again she nodded, and her hands turned into fists.

"Would you say that he looked like a man who was about to commit suicide?"

"Oh, no. He was smiling and joking. He even tried to make a pass at me. It was the first time I had been alone with him in the office. Usually, the girl was there, too."

English's mouth tightened.

"What happened?"

"He tried to kiss me, but I got out of his way. I gave him the money and left."

"You gave him the money? Two hundred dollars?"

"Yes."

"You're sure about that, Julie? It's important."

"Yes, I gave it to him."

"It wasn't found. He had only four dollars on him. Lois went through the office very carefully. She didn't find any money anywhere."

"Well, I gave it to him. He put it on his desk and put a paper weight on top of it."

English stroked his jaw, his eyes brooding.

"I think that that about clinches it," he said, half to himself. "Roy was murdered."

Julie closed her eyes.

"Did you see anyone or hear anything when you were up there?" English went on, watching her.

"No, nothing. Only the machines in the office along the passage. They were making a lot of noise."

"Well, someone shot him and took the money," English said. "It didn't walk out of the office on its own. Someone took it."

"What will happen, Nick?" she asked, her eyes scared.

"I have a man working on it," English said, tossing his cigarette into the fire. "There's nothing for you to worry about, Julie. No one knows you went up there, and no one is going to know. You can forget about it."

"But if someone murdered him, shouldn't the police be told?"

"If it gets out that Roy ran an organized blackmail racket, I'm sunk," English said quietly. "I'm not telling the police a thing. It's up to them to find out for themselves. My man may find the killer, and if he does, we shall have to decide what to do with them. There's nothing for you to worry about in any way." He went over to her and took her hand in his. "Now I've got to run along, Julie. Have a rest and forget about this. I'll see you tomorrow."

"Yes, Nick."

She got up and went with him into the lobby. While he was putting on his coat, she stood near him, watching him, her eyes uneasy.

"Nick, wouldn't it be better if you forget all this yourself? Must you hunt for this man? If you did find him, you couldn't hand him over to the police. He might talk and give Roy away."

English smiled at her.

"Don't worry your head about that. I have to find him first. Roy may have been a louse and a rat, but no one's going to murder one of my family and get away with it. I'll think of a way of fixing this guy when I've found him." He kissed her and patted her hip. "Don't worry."

He went down to where Chuck was waiting patiently.

As Chuck drove rapidly through the dark streets, English sat still, his face thoughtful, his mind busy.

He went straight up to his apartment and tossed his coat to Ushu, his Filipino boy.

"Anyone waiting to see me?" he asked.

"No, sir."

"No calls?"

"No, sir."

English nodded and went into his study. He sat down at the desk and reached for a cigar. When he had lit it, he sat thinking for a few minutes, then he picked up the telephone.

"Get me Police Captain O'Brien, Police Headquarters, Boston," he told the girl at the switchboard.

"Yes, Mr. English."

He hung up, and got to his feet, and began to pace slowly up and down. After a little delay, the telephone rang.

"Hello, Mr. English. Well, well, you are a stranger," O'Brien's voice boomed over the line.

"Hello, Tom. How are you?"

"I'm fine. How's yourself?"

"Oh, I'm alive. I was expecting you at the fight. Why didn't you come?"

"You know how it is. I got a couple of murders on my hands right now. Glad your boy won. Seems like a good scrap."

"It was all right. Look, Tom, I want a quick favor."

"Anything you say, Mr. English."

"Some eight years ago, a girl named Julie Clair was arrested for stealing money from her landlady. She drew a week in jail. Can you check that?"

"I guess so," O'Brien returned. "Give me three minutes."

English sat on the edge of the desk, swinging his leg, his eyes brooding, cigar smoke drifting past his face.

In less than three minutes, O'Brien came on the line again.

"No one of that name was arrested, Mr. English. We have no record of her." \- Nick's face hardened.

"Any record of any girl arrested for stealing money from her landlady about that time?"

"I'll see," O'Brien said, and there was a long pause. Then he said, "A girl named Doris Caspary—she got a week in jail because she had been shoplifting the previous month."

English remembered Julie had once mentioned sharing rooms with a girl named Doris Caspary. Once he had heard a name, he never forgot it.

"Julie Clair was a witness for the defense," O'Brien went on. "But she wasn't charged."

"Thanks, O'Brien, I must have got my facts muddled," English returned. "Don't forget to let me know when you are coming to town."

He hung up and frowned down at the carpet. He had had an idea that Julie had been lying the moment she had started telling him the story of the theft.

"Now, I wonder what you've been up to, Julie?" he said half aloud, as he walked toward the apartment door.
