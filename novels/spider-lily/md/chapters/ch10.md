### Chapter 10

## Negotiation for a Name

I left the house through the back door when I heard some of the poker players at the front door. Ursula had asked me to go easy on using the car because she was short on gas coupons, but I didn’t intend to drive far.

The telephone directory said that Emil Schneider lived on Ivy Lane. There was a mailbox with his name on it, but it was lined up with eight or ten others at the head of the road. At the first house Mr. Rosenberg was watering his lawn. I stopped the car and asked him where Schneider lived.

Mr. Rosenberg peered at me through the deepening twilight, then turned off the water at the nozzle and came to the car. His son had been one of my close friends. “Alec Linn,” he said, recognizing me.

“I heard Dave was killed in Germany,” I said. “It was a great shock.”

“Yes.” The man had aged a great deal. “Well, Alec, I’m glad you came through all right.”

I felt a flash of resentment that was always with me now, before I realized that he meant the war and not the trial.

“Which house is Schneider’s?” I asked again.

“You’re going to visit Emil Schneider?” There was incredulity in his voice. He knew about Schneider and Lily, of course. Everybody did since the trial.

“Why not?” I said pugnaciously.

Mr. Rosenberg gave me a long solemn stare. Then he said: “Turn up the second driveway on the right and go as far as you can.”

All I saw when I came to the end of the second driveway was a shed garage. I had to get out of the car before I spotted the house a couple of hundred feet away. That was the closest you could drive to it. From there you walked up wooden steps with flimsy birch rails and weaved along a flagstone path through elaborate rock gardens and patches of sloping lawn. The Schneiders must have just come from a big city when they built this house. We small-town folk like to drive up to our front doors.

When I reached the porch, I looked back. I knew all the chaotic odds and ends of roads and lanes in West Amber. James Street and Ivy Lane ran more or less parallel, and from here it was a short walk down the driveway, across Ivy Lane, and along a footpath through the woods to the back of George Winkler’s house on James Street. Which meant also, approximately, to the back of the bungalow in which Lily had lived and died.

***

I rang the bell. There was no answer, but there was light in a second floor window, so I kept my finger on the button. Light went on in the downstairs hall. Emil Schneider opened the door.

“Linn,” he said and took a backward step as if afraid I would hit him. He was in his underwear shirt, and his long loose body was thinner than I had thought. His mustache was no longer streamlined and stubble deprived his face of its normal sleekness. “I want to talk to you,” I said.

“What about?” he asked nervously.

“Don’t be afraid. You weren’t the only one who made love to Lily. I need your help.”

“For what?”

“To find out who murdered her.”

He stood in the doorway looking at me speculatively. “Come in,” he said.

I followed him into the living room. Dust was an inch thick on the furniture. Ashtrays overflowed and the table was piled with old newspapers. This was a house in which there was no woman and the man had stopped caring about it.

Schneider ducked out of the room and returned with a bottle of whiskey and two glasses. I shook my head. He ignored the glasses and took a long pull directly from the bottle. Then he smacked his lips and said: “You were acquitted. What difference does it make to you who murdered her?”

“So you know I didn’t murder her?”

“What’s that?”

“Everybody else assumes that I did. Why don’t you?”

Schneider put down the bottle, eyed it longingly, decided not to, and sat down. “I take your word for it,” he said.

I walked to his chair and stood over him, fighting to keep my voice low and my hands steady. “You know I didn’t kill her because you did.”

“Oh, hell!” he said wearily. “Haven’t I been kicked around enough without you trying it?”

“You’ve been kicked around!”

“All right, both of us.” He seemed about to burst into tears. “Do you know what I was doing when you rang the bell? I was upstairs packing my clothes. I’m taking the seven-twelve train out of this damn town in the morning and never coming back. Yesterday I had divorce papers slapped on me. Eventually my wife would have forgotten and forgiven and would have come back to me with the children, but somebody sent her newspaper clippings of the trial and that finished me with her. Her lawyer who served the papers also told me to get out of this house. When I built it eight years ago I had a judgment against me and put the house in her name, so legally it’s all hers. On top of that, I was fired from my job. Those sanctimonious stuffed shirts at the bank don’t want a teller who was forced to admit in public that he was making love to a married woman. If I had more guts I’d put a bullet in my head.”

***

If he hadn’t had such an abundance of pity for himself, I might have pitied him a little. I knew what Lily could do to a man, and even now that she was dead she was not finished.

“Then why not tell me the truth?” I said.

“What truth?”

“Whatever it is. I can’t see you running to the district attorney when you heard Lily was murdered and telling him you had spoken to her on the phone. Why stick your neck out? Why put yourself in a position where your affair with Lily would probably be made public? It would have been smarter to have sat tight and not have mentioned that phone call at all.’

His attempt at laughter was between a sob and a giggle. “I learned what a mistake it is to be a public-spirited citizen.”

“You chose the lesser of the two evils,” I said. “You did phone Lily that night, but the truth doesn’t end there. She didn’t know that I was back; she asked you to see her that night, or consented to your coming over. You left for her bungalow at once. It took you less than five minutes to walk through the woods. What you did when you got there you know better than anybody else. Then you recalled that there are no private phones in this area. Any of the other seven parties on your line could have overheard you making the date with Lily. If you didn’t come forward to tell about that phone call, somebody else might, and it would look a lot better for you if you did it yourself.”

“And if anybody had heard me make a date to go there, where would I have stood?”

“Not worse off. The testimony of an eavesdropper and a gossip would not be worth much if you got in your version first.”

He studied a red and green pattern in the rug at his feet. “So I went to Lily’s that night, eh?”

“Nothing else explains the way you acted.”

Schneider rose for another slug of whiskey. He watched me as he drank, and the speculative gleam appeared again in his eyes. When he put down the bottle, he said: “How important is it to you to know who murdered Lily?”

“Very important.”

He nodded slowly, as if in agreement with himself. “I told you my wife gets the house. About every cent I have is in it—or every cent I thought I had. I played the stock market last winter and took a licking. Tomorrow morning I’m going to Chicago where I have a brother who’ll help me find a job. But I need money to keep me going until then.”

My stomach turned in disgust. “What do you want to sell me?”

“The name of the murderer.”

“It wasn’t you?”

His laughter jarred my nerves, “I’m not kidding. I need money badly and I have what you want.”

“How much?”

“Five thousand dollars.”

“What do I get for it?”

“A name.”

In other words, nothing. But I had less than nothing now.

“Will you go to the district attorney with me?” I asked.

He was back in the chair and had resumed his inspection of the rug. “Absolutely not.”

“What can I do with just a name?”

“That’s up to you. Whether you buy or not, I’m leaving on the seven- twelve train tomorrow morning.”

***

Five thousand dollars was thirty-five hundred more than I had to my name. But I could somehow get my hands on the rest if I had to.

“How do I know the name is the right one?” I said. “You might pluck it out of the air.”

He shrugged without looking at me. “It’s not easy for me to do this. You won’t believe me, but before I met Lily I was a pretty decent sort of guy. I’ll take your money, but I won’t lie to you.”

“Unless the right name is yours and that’s why you’re running away. What proof can you give me that you’re playing straight with me?”

“I can tell you how I know who murdered her.”

I walked over to the whiskey bottle, but kept my hand from reaching for it. “All right, tell me.”

Schneider leaned forward from his hips, the rug absorbing his attention. “You’re right about the phone call and why I told Hackett about it. Since my wife left me I’ve known that somebody has been listening in on my phone conversations, especially on incoming calls when they picked up the phone in the hope that it would be Lily. I’ve no idea who it is; likely some busybody, gossiping old woman. So Lily and I always pretended we were talking about houses she was interested in buying. Like when we spoke at ten o’clock that night. I didn’t phone her; she phoned me. I guess she was bored and wanted one fling with me before you came back. I’m not sure. She just said she wanted to discuss the house we’d looked at a couple of weeks ago and I knew what she meant and said I’d be right over.

I was so eager I didn’t even stop to put on a hat.”

He lifted his eyes and the bitterness in them startled me. “Damn her to hell! Both of us ought to be glad she’s dead. I don’t know how you feel, Linn, but I’m not glad. That’s why I damn her.” He shook himself. “You’re right, I cut through the woods to her bungalow. I approached from the back. I saw somebody come out through the back door. There was something queer about the way that person went to the road, going to the trees a short distance away and keeping in their shadow all the way. Then I lost sight of”—he hesitated—“the person. The car must have been parked a way down the road, headed toward town, because half a minute later I heard a motor start and a car leave.”

“A car dashed by me at the head of James Street.”

“It could have been that car. You must have been pretty close at that time, though I left before you got there. I was puzzled by the way that person had acted. I went in through the back door and across the kitchen and into the living room. I saw Lily on the floor. I bent over her and she was dead. Then I tyeat it.”

“Why didn’t you call the police?”

“Did you?”

“I was too stunned to think of it,” I said.

“I was stunned too, but not enough to lose my head. Look at what happened to you because the sheriff found you there with the body. Don’t you think I would have got that treatment if it had been me instead? My wife had left me because of Lily and now Lily was giving me the brush-off because you were coming home. What better motive could the district attorney ask for? I ducked out of there as fast as I could and kept going until I was home.”

***

I wasn’t much of a drinker, but now I couldn’t resist Schneider’s whiskey. I filled one of the two glasses. Some of the liquor slopped over my chin. The place had become a hothouse.

“Was it a man or woman?” I asked, putting down the glass.

He shook his head. “You have all the free information I’m giving you.”

“Did you recognize the person?”

“There wouldn’t be any point to this if I hadn’t. Light from the house flowed on the person when the person came out through the back door.”

“Do you know Don Yard and Bertha Kaleman?”

“Last spring I spent a weekend in New York and Lily met me there. That was why my wife left me. Somebody saw me with Lily and told her. This town is full of nosey, scandal hungry—” His mouth twisted. “Anyway, Lily and I went to a nightclub. A squat, very broad man came to our table and said hello to Lily. He didn’t once glance at me. After a minute he went back to his table where a hot-looking redhead was waiting for him. Lily told me that he was Don Yard, her former husband, and that the redhead was his current mistress, Bertha Kaleman.”

“Would you have recognized either Don Yard or Bertha Kaleman months later seeing them for only a moment?”

“I would have,” he said, “but it’s no use fishing for information. I told you enough to show you that I know more. Five thousand dollars will get you the sex and the name.”

“I could tell the district attorney what you just told me.”

Schneider snorted. He was looking at me more often now. He was gaining confidence, getting the feel of the business enterprise.

“I’ll say you lied.”

“The name won’t do me any good unless you back it up.”

“I couldn’t if I wanted to. I can’t prove I saw anybody. All I’ll get out of it is a perjury charge against me for having lied on the witness stand. Bring that five thousand dollars cash before midnight and the name is yours.”

“Cash?” I said. “How can I raise that much money at night? If you wait till the bank opens on Monday—”

“I’m leaving at seven-twelve tomorrow morning with or without the money. I don’t trust you not to stop a check after I tell you the name. That’s why it has to be cash. You have lots of rich friends in town. Your sister always keeps some cash in the house; she cashed a four hundred dollar check at the bank last Thursday. Then there’s Oliver Spencer. There’s no night depository at the bank, so he keeps the Saturday receipts in a wall safe at home until Monday morning. That’s generally around two thousand dollars, most of it in cash.”

“But five thousand dollars!”

“You can scrape the rest up elsewhere. That’s your problem.” He took another look at the rug design and added indifferently: “Take it or leave it.”

How would I figure his hand in a poker game? He’d be the eager kind in a bluff, a super-salesman if he had nothing of value. But he wasn’t playing it that way. He didn’t seem greatly interested in the pot.

“I’ll see what I can do,” I said.

He nodded vaguely, as if he had stopped caring one way or the other. He had gone down a long way from the solid citizen, the family man and home-owner I used to see in the bank cage. Lily had done that to him. He had sunk down among the worms, but there was enough man left in him to give himself an out. That part of him preferred that I turn his offer down and save what was left of his soul.

I decided to call him. Except that unlike poker I lost if he bluffed and won if he held a strong hand. And I wouldn’t be able to tell whether I’d won or lost. He’d give me a name, but how could I know it was the right one? It was a gamble any way you looked at it. I’d gambled before with a lot less at stake.

I said suddenly: “You can make more money by blackmailing the murderer.”

His eyes blazed. “Damn you! What do you think I am?”

There were a lot of words in the language for him, but I didn’t use any of them. “I’ll raise as much as I can,” I said and walked past his feet.

He didn’t speak until I was at the front door. Then he called after me: “Try to make it by midnight.”
