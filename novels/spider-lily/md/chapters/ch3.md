### Chapter 3

## Blood on the Lily

There were subdued voices in the living room. I went in there instead of down to the basement. On the couch in front of the dead fireplace Bevis Spencer was holding Miriam’s hand. He turned his head sharply when he heard me and dropped her hand in confusion and clambered up to his feet.

“It’s swell to see you back,” he said, grabbing my hand between his two palms.

My throat made polite noises of greeting.

Bevis was Oliver Spencer’s son, but in no way like his small, bald, go-getter father. He was a head taller and had a thick unruly mop of hair which would last forever and he was awkward and embarrassed with strangers. He had opened up only a little since our high school days when he’d been a moody, unsmiling boy who kept more or less to himself. The only reason I had come to know him fairly well was that in those days I had a crush on his sister Helen and spent considerable time in the Spencer house.

“I begged the Army doctors to pass me,” Bevis was saying, “but they refused. I’ll always feel I missed something big.”

“You missed something all right,” I told him, “You’ll never know how lucky you were. Do you mind if I speak to Miriam alone?”

She had been pushing back her hair from her brow and readjusting her bun. When I said that, her hands paused at the sides of her head, but she didn’t look up at me.

Bevis glowered at me. Glowering came easy to those deep-set eyes under overhanging brows. “I was on my way downstairs anyway,” he said without enthusiasm. “They have only four hands and I promised to make a fifth.”

I waited until he was out in the hall before I turned to Miriam. She spoke first.

“Bevis wants to marry me, Alec.”

That was why he had glowered at me. I’d be sore too if somebody had barged in at a time like that. I told her that I was sorry that I’d come in at the wrong moment.

“It doesn’t matter,” he said. “Bevis has been proposing to me about once a month during the last year. I’d just put him off again.”

“He’s too gloomy for you.”

He brightens up a lot when you know him well. He s intelligent and considerate and sweet.”

“So what’s wrong?”

Miriam didn’t answer. She stood up and went to the table and took a cigarette out of the translucent plastic cigarette-box. I noticed for the first time since my return that she’d put on weight. Just about enough weight. She had been too skinny since childhood and now her figure was pleasantly mature and her angular face no longer had that pinched look. She was a very attractive girl. Not beautiful like Lily or Helen Spencer and perhaps not even pretty if you took her features apart, but the black-eyed, dark-skinned animation of her face made up for it.

“I don’t know what to do, Alec,” she said after a pause.

***

It was my duty to be the sympathetic confidant and advisor and discuss her problem with her far into the night. I was the man of the household, the nearest thing to a father or brother she had. But I had a problem of my own which was a lot more urgent than hers. To me, anyway.

“Where s Lily?” I demanded.

She took the unlighted cigarette from her mouth. “Ursula told you.”

“Cut it out! ” I realized I had shouted that and lowered my voice. “Lily isn’t living in this house.”

She put a match to her cigarette. She had trouble getting a light. Then she said: “No, she isn’t.”

“What’s happened to her?”

“Don’t get frightened. She’s in the best of health as far as I know.”

I gripped her arm. She uttered a little exclamation and I loosened my fingers. “She walked out on me, didn’t she?”

“No, Alec, she didn’t. She—Ursula—” she drew in smoke and made a fresh start. “Ursula asked her to leave the house.”

“Why?”

“You’d better ask Ursula.”

“When did this happen?”

“Two weeks ago.”

Panting, I stepped back. It wasn’t Lily’s fault that she hadn’t met me at the station. That was good to know.

“Where’s Lily now?”

“She’s living somewhere right here in town.”

So Lily hadn’t walked out on me, as for almost a year now I had thought she might. She could have moved back to the bright lights and gayety of New York when Ursula had kicked her out. Instead she had remained in this dull town where I would be able to find her at once.

I struggled to keep my voice under control. “You mean to say that you didn’t let Lily know that I was coming home today?”

“Ursula wanted to have a talk with you before you saw Lily.”

“About why she threw Lily out of the house? Why did she?”

Miriam brought the cigarette up to her mouth. It trembled against her lips and she tossed it into the fireplace. She was nearly as upset as I was. “Ursula will tell you.”

“Why didn’t she tell me before this?”

“She wanted to break it gently.”

“Because she thinks I’m a mental case and wants to cushion the shock?”

***

Miriam put a hand on my chest.

Her dark, intense eyes were misty. “Please, Alec, try to understand how we feel. Ursula is anxious that you hear our side first. She planned to have a long talk with you after dinner, but then the men arrived for the poker game.”

“So poker is more important than I am? Is that it?”

“Alec, that’s not fair.”

“All right,” I conceded. “So she found excuses to put it off because she was afraid to tell me. She thinks I’m not in a fit mental state to take bad news. It must be pretty bad if Ursula kicked her out of the house. It was because of a man, wasn’t it?”

She reached for another cigarette, although she hadn’t taken more than a couple of puffs on the one she’d discarded. “Ursula will tell you all about it.”

“She had her chance. What’s Lily’s address?”

“Alec, please have a talk with Ursula first.”

“Where is Lily staying?” I yelled.

“Ursula asked me not to say anything until she—”

I swung away from her and went out to the hall and ran down the basement stairs.

The cardroom took up half the cellar and was more cozily furnished than any other room in the house. It had an oak floor and a beamed ceiling and was panelled in cedar. There was a tiny bar in one corner and a radio and a couple of leather lounge chairs in another and at the far end of the room a bridge table which was seldom used. The round poker table, big enough to seat ten players, dominated the room. The red leather chairs were custom- built for a person’s bones and the neon lights were as soft as a summer dawn.

Sheriff Owen Dowie was dealing when I burst in. They were playing stud and Dowie’s arm paused in midair as he was about to slide Bevis Spencer’s fourth card across the table. There must have been something in my face that made Dowie and Ursula and George Winkler, facing the door, stare at me. Oliver Spencer and Bevis Spencer turned in their chairs and added their stares to the others.

I said: “Ursula, where is Lily staying?”

She started to rise from her chair. “I told you—”

“You lied,” I said. “She’s in town.” Ursula rose all the way and flashed an angry look over my shoulder. Miriam had followed me down the stairs and stood behind me, just inside the doorway. Ursula turned back to the table. “I’m sorry, gentlemen, but you’ll have to excuse me for a few minutes.”

“I don’t want to break up the game,”

I said. “I only want to know where to find my wife.”

Ursula came around the chair and took my arm. “Let’s go upstairs, Alec,” she said in the gentle tone one uses to a sick child.

“Like hell!” I said. “All I want to hear from you is Lily’s address.”

“Alec, if you’ll listen—”

I shook her off and went up to the table. “Some of you men must know where Lily is. Bevis, you can tell me.”

Bevis dropped his eyes to his cards.

He had a seven and a queen showing, and the card which Dowie still held in his hand would be his second queen. Dowie was peering curiously at me through the thick lenses of his glasses George Winkler fumbled with a cigar wrapper. Oliver Spencer brushed back non-existent hair on his head.

“You’re all in on this!” I said. I was shouting. I’d been shouting since I entered the room. I didn’t care; I’d keep on shouting. “Don’t think I’m a dope. I’ve an idea what Lily was up to while I was away. It was between the lines of everything she wrote me. But now I’m back, and, by God—”

My voice choked off in my throat. This wasn’t any of their business. It was too personal to invite anybody in on my agony.

There was a brittle silence while I pulled out my handkerchief to wipe my sweating face. Then George Winkler sighed as loudly as a gust of wind sweeping through the room.

“Alec, she’s not worth it,” he said.

“None of your damn business!” I flung at him. “I don’t need any of you to tell me how to handle my wife. Where is she?”

Ursula was back at my side, clawing at my arm. “Alec, control yourself. If you’ll come upstairs with me for just five minutes—”

“Why should I control myself? Where’s my wife?”

Suddenly she looked very tired. Her broad shoulders drooped. “Have it your way. She s staying in a bungalow on James Street.”

“Thanks,” I said bitterly and turned to the door. Miriam was still standing there. She stepped out of the way and I brushed past her and raced out of the house.

A coupe was swinging into the driveway when I reached the road. Somebody called my name and the car stopped broadside to me. By the dash light I saw Kerry Nugent behind the wheel and Helen Spencer beside him.

They d come to visit me, of course. Kerry would ask me how I was and I would ask him how he was and he’d tell me the latest news about airmen we knew all over the world and whom you were always running into or hearing about and how soon he expected to return to active duty. I did not want any talk at all tonight except with Lily, and not too much talk with her.

I said, “I’ll see you tomorrow, Kerry,” and moved past the coupe and out to the road.

“Alec!”

I glanced back. Kerry had the door open and one foot out. I put my head down and walked as rapidly as I could without quite running, fleeing from the conspiracy to keep me from my wife’s arms.

***

At the bottom of the hill I paused.

James Street was two miles away, yet I’d run right past Ursula’s car which was still parked in the driveway. I was a guy in such a terrific hurry that I was taking ten times as long walking as it would to drive. I hadn’t even had sense to bring along a flashlight.

It would still save time to go back for the car, but some of them might be outside the house and I couldn’t face them again. Not now, anyway. I walked on and came to the fifteenth tee of the golf course where it angled toward the road. As kids we used to take a short cut diagonally across the course to the second hole, saving perhaps half a mile. I climbed the stone boundary wall and by the sickly light of the waning moon started across the fairway.

George Winkler had said that Lily wasn’t good enough for me or not worth it or something like that. Whatever it was, he had put in to indefinite language the vaguer fears caused by her letters or not hearing at all from her for weeks. Did George know or had he handed me town gossip? And would Ursula have kicked her out without certain knowledge?

Face it. Two years ago she was your wife for three days and nights and after that you were strangers who didn’t again see each other. While you yearned in loneliness and faithfulness at the other end of the world, she did not keep her bed always empty. What were you going to do about it?

Nothing.

Nothing tonight and perhaps nothing tomorrow or the day after that. I wanted her. I hated her and wanted her, as I had hated her and wanted her for a long time now, submerging dread and fear in the memory of those three nights and the never-ending hunger for her.

I’d use the Lily’s beautiful body. I’d satisfy my need for her. And after that—

I didn’t know. I didn’t want to know tonight.

At the second hole I came out on Old Mill Road at the edge of town. My watch said seven minutes to ten. Too early for her to be asleep. I would like that, finding her in bed and waking her with kisses.

But suppose she didn’t want you? Suppose her body had no more ardor for you than her letters had had?

By God, I’d take her anyway! Brutally. I’d hurt her. I’d—

I stopped to catch my breath. I hadn’t been walking rapidly since I had reached the bottom of the hill, but all the same I was drawing air into my lungs with labored gasps. I fumbled out a cigarette, lighted it, and the smoke felt good inside me. I walked along the clearly defined macadam road.

***

James Street. It wasn’t actually a street; there weren’t any in West Amber except for the three which comprised the business section. It was a tar road. Along either side houses were spotted at varying intervals. There was a mile of it, and like a sap I’d left the cardroom without asking just where on James Street Lily lived.

A car approached. I stood in the middle of the road and waved in the hope that whoever was in the car could tell me where to find her. The headlights bore down on me. The car did not slacken speed; it seemed determined to run me down. I jumped and felt the wind of its passing.

I cursed the driver for a madman, glad to be able to curse something, and went on. The mailboxes stood on the right side of the road. One of them should bear her name. I struck matches to read the boxes, passing up those in front of houses in which I knew she could not be because they were too large or I knew the people who lived in them.

Like George Winkler’s white brick house. When I passed it, light went on in an upstairs room. That would be Amy Winkler, George’s spinster sister who kept house for him. She knew everything there was to know in town. She would tell me, but she would also gush over me in greeting. I kept walking.

Two boxes farther on I came to it. The name JOSEPHS was crossed out with black crayon, and under it was waveringly printed: LILY LINN.

Linn. My name. The name I had given to my wife.

It was suddenly very good to be home. The fact remained that she had stayed on here in West Amber to wait for my return. That was all that counted. The rest was merely an inability to write letters as passionate as her embraces. She was waiting for me and I was coming to her.

It was a neat little stucco bungalow just off the road. Every window was lighted. With both hands I brushed back my wild hair and ran my handkerchief over my face and went up to the door. I flicked my tongue over my dry lips and knocked.

There was no sound in the house. She wouldn’t have gone out and left all the lights on. Perhaps she had dropped off to sleep while reading. The door was unlocked. I pushed it in.

The door opened directly into a small living room. I saw her at once. She was lying on the floor at the side of a reed couch.

I closed the door behind me and walked slowly into the room, not thinking, not feeling anything except some thing jumping in the emptiness inside of me.

She was on her side, turned away from me, her knees bent. I squatted beside her and put a hand on her shoulder.

Then I saw the knife in her breast. I reached over her shoulder and grabbed the handle and started to pull the knife out. It came out easily. It came halfway out, and suddenly I jerked my hand away from the knife as if it had turned glowing hot.

The truth hit me like a kick in the stomach. The Lily was dead. Nobody lives with a knife in his heart.

I straightened up beside her and at once my knees started to bend. I sank down on the couch. The room wavered.

I put my head in my hands, closing my eyes tight against the darkness of my palms.

***

It was very still. Somewhere a clock ticked. I dared take my hands from my face and the room had straightened out. My head remained bent; I was looking down at her legs.

One foot was covered by a satin mule. The other foot was bare and the mule which belonged to it lay behind her. She wore no stockings and the nails of her toes were scarlet. The first time I had ever seen her without any clothes on I had, oddly, noticed first of all her painted toenails. They had shocked me a little and excited me.

She was wearing the heavy silk hostess gown with the tawny-orange tiger lilies. I had bought it for her the day we were married. Lilies for Lily, I had said. A poor joke, perhaps, but the kind you delight in on honeymoons. During all the breakfasts I’d had with her, the first in the New York hotel room and the other two at home, she had worn it. The hem had hiked up on her body and her uppermost thigh was naked. It was a lovely thigh, smooth and rounded, and even now I could remember the firm warm feel of it.

Sitting bent over, that was all I could see of her. I didn’t want to see any more, but I had to. I raised my head an inch and let my eyes move up the crumpled form.

The knife protruded from the swell of her left breast. The dull black handle of a kitchen knife. There was a tiger lily on each breast, and I remembered telling her one morning that those two, and one other, were my favorite lilies of all the many on the hostess gown. The knife had pierced the one over her left breast, and it was no longer tawny-orange. Her life had dyed it red.

My eyes remained on the bloody lily, not wanting to look higher. A body is a body, living or dead, but a face—

I looked. Her face was no longer beautiful, no longer elfin—no longer anything but dead.

Then the shakes got me, as badly as that first time when we’d jumped from our gasless plane and I was bending over Kerry Nugent who was tangled in his parachute. Joe Klintcamp, the copilot, had slapped me and that had helped. There was nobody to slap me now. I dropped my head and shook and felt sweat cover me.

It didn’t last long. It was passing when I heard the door open. I looked up and Sheriff Owen Dowie stood in the doorway peering myopically at Lily.

He didn’t say anything at first. He closed the door and came forward and knelt beside her. Then he shifted his gaze up to me. His pinched face was sad.

“I’m sorry about this, Linn,” he said.

I hadn’t heard the sheriff’s car, but I heard the second car pull up. We both turned our heads, listening to a car door slam. Then there was a knock and a man said: “Alec?”

Dowie looked at me to see what I would do about it. I just sat there. The knock came again. “Lily?” Dowie said quietly: “Come in.”

It was Kerry Nugent. He gawked at Dowie in surprise and took a step or two into the room before he saw her. “Alec,” he said weakly. He came on to Dowie’s side. “Is she dead?”

“He stuck a knife in her heart,” Dowie said.

He? Whom did Dowie mean? I heard the clock. Why were they so very quiet?

“You don’t think—” I said. Their faces told me what they thought. “My God, I didn’t kill her!”

Kerry turned his eyes away from me. “I’m sorry, Linn,” Dowie said again.
