### Chapter 4

## The Jail

Ursula stopped inside the cell and sent a startled, shocked glance over her shoulder at the door closing behind her. Then she kissed me quickly on the mouth and thrust a package into my hands, like an embarrassed little girl presenting a gift at a birthday party. “One of your chess sets,” she said.

“Thanks.” I tossed the package on the cot and led her to the wooden chair. “Sit on that. It’s softer than the cot.” Her big frame perched unrelaxed on the edge of the chair. She looked about. A second was enough to take in everything there was to be seen. She shuddered. “How horrible for you!”

“A bit cramped,” I conceded, “but the food is wholesome and the turnkey does little favors for me if I keep his palm greased. My chief complaint is that a vicious character like me is allowed only two visitors a week, not counting lawyers.”

“And they wouldn’t let me visit you at all the first week and they wouldn’t let Miriam come up with me.” Ursula removed a fleck of tobacco from her lip. “I’m glad that you’re taking it so well, Alec. I was afraid—I mean—”

“That I’d crack wide open?” I said. “That I was a psychoneurotic even before they tossed me in here and that I’d pound on the door and chew the mattress?”

“Alec, please! ”

“All right, I’m scared,” I said. “There’s still a trial between me and the death house, but the last time the district attorney talked to me he was already gloating over the two thousand volts of electricity which—”

“Alec!”

I stood up. I walked the five paces to the other end of the cell and lit a cigarette. I was sweating, but not much, and my hand was not unsteady. I returned to Ursula.

“I can take it,” I said. “It’s easier than sweating out a mission. The odds against me aren’t much greater than trying to get home after bombing Singapore. George Winkler hasn’t been around in a couple of days. What’s he doing about me?”

“I want to talk to you about that. We’ve retained a very big lawyer from New York named Robin Magee.”

“What’s the matter with George?”

“He will be associated with Magee. George does not think he has had enough experience in criminal law, and Robin Magee is supposed to be marvelous.”

“Expensive as hell, I bet.”

“Does that matter?”

“I’m grateful,” I said. “When I get out and start earning a living, I’ll pay you back. It’ll cost more than you think. Is George hiring private detectives?”

“Why private detectives?”

“To find the murderer, if possible. That’s what the police should be doing, but they’re so sure that I’m the one that they’re not bothering.”

She didn’t say anything. I sat down on the cot and stared at her. Her eyes lifted; there were tears in them.

“So you agree with the police,” I said slowly.

She propelled herself out of the chair and flung her arms about me. “Alec, it’s my fault. I should have had that talk with you as soon as you got off the train. I kept putting it off. I wanted you to rest after your journey. But I only made it worse for you. It must have been such a shock when Miriam blurted it out to you.”

“Let Miriam alone,” I said. “She didn’t tell me anything.”

She pressed her face against my arm. “I never liked Lily, especially not for you, but I should have let her stay in the house until you came home. It was only a couple of weeks.”

“Was Lily cutting up as badly as that?”

“There was gossip.”

“Is that all?” I said. “Nothing but gossip?”

“Well, she was seen drinking with a strange man.”

“Damn it!” I was on my feet, pacing the cell and slamming my left palm with my right fist. I wanted to break somebody’s neck, but I didn’t know whose. “Just gossip. Just drinking with another man. She didn’t walk out on me even after you kicked her out. She stayed around to wait for me.” Ursula’s jaw hung slack. “You thought from my actions that she was carrying on an affair with somebody else? Oh, God! If I’d minded my business—”

I swung to face her. “I wouldn’t have rushed off to kill her? You believe that, too!”

The door was flung open. The beanpole turnkey stood there. “What’s the yelling about?”

I took a deep breath. “I got excited. It’s nothing.”

“Well, the lady’s time is up. If you want any more visitors, Linn, keep it quiet.”

Ursula turned a rigidly set face up to me to be kissed. Her lips were cold. “Alec,” she said, “I know you’re not a murderer.”

“Sure.” I squeezed her arm. “Get the idea out of your head that Lily was murdered because of anything you did or didn’t do. It had nothing to do with you or me. Remind George Winkler about hiring private detectives.”

“Time’s up, lady,” the turnkey said. Ursula nodded dully and went.

***

I wasn’t sure what there should be about a lawyer to inspire confidence, but Robin Magee didn’t in me. He was a tall, slightly stooped man with hair graying aristocratically at the fringes, and he was dressed like an actor or an English politician. His breath smelled of very good liquor.

George Winkler sat on the chair and I on the cot. Robin Magee remained on his feet and tossed me a benign smile. “Now let’s hear your story, my boy.”

“I told it to the district attorney and I told it to George,” I said. “It hasn’t changed since then.”

Magee nodded amiably. “It may be that you will mention something in the retelling which you overlooked before.” So I told it again. There was surprisingly little. I had walked in and found Lily with a knife in her heart.

There was a silence when I finished. George looked up at Magee. The great criminal lawyer from New York smiled silkily.

“Why did you touch the knife handle?” he asked.

“I started to pull it out. Then I realized that she was already dead.”

“The knife was in her heart. Didn’t you see that?”

“My brain stopped working for a few seconds.”

Magee studied the ceiling. “They tell me you are a very bright young man. You must have known that it was not proper to touch a murder weapon, and that pulling the knife out wouldn’t have helped her even if she were still alive.”

“I wasn’t in a state to realize anything.”

“You were a soldier. You must have seen many dead people.”

He sounded a lot like District Attorney Hackett questioning me, but he was being paid to be on my side. I said: “I’ve seen dead men, but I’ve never before walked in on my wife with a knife in her heart. Did you?”

Magee chuckled. “Naturally not.”

“Then how the hell do you know how a man will act at such a time?”

“You were a navigator of a Superfortress,” he argued. “You were trained to keep your head in an emergency.”

“There was nothing in my training about how to act when I found my wife murdered. What are you getting at, anyway?”

George put in: “Didn’t the D. A. ask you those questions?”

“Yes.”

“We’ve got to know what you told him, don’t we?”

“That’s right,” I agreed. “Okay, throw ’em at me.”

Robin Magee dropped down on the cot. He did not hold my hand, but his manner was so intimate that he might have. His breath made me thirsty. “It looks bad, my boy. There’s no getting away from it. There are many witnesses that you left your house in a highly excited state of mind—unfortunately, one of them the sheriff. Then you were found bending over the body—”

“I was sitting on the couch.”

“You were sitting on the couch and she was at your feet. And the police laboratory found your fingerprints on the knife and no other prints.”

‘‘The murderer had wiped his off.”

“Let us grant that. This morning I had a talk with the D. A. He did not tell me m so many words, but he implied that he had even more definite proof than the medical examiner’s report that she had been alive a very short time before Sheriff Dowie found you there. He gave me this much to induce me to accept a second-degree plea.”

“Did you tell him to go to hell?”

“In effect, yes.”

Magee tapped my chest with his knuckles. “My boy, Winkler and I are going to get you off absolutely free. You may have to spend a month or two in a sanatorium, but even that will probably be unnecessary.”

***

It took time to penetrate. I looked from one pair of eyes to the other, both pairs watching me anxiously. Then I left the cot to get as far from them as I could, and turned at the wall.

“So that’s it,” I said. “I’m insane.”

“Not at all.” Magee’s honeyed words flowed to me. “Temporary insanity, perhaps. Extenuating circumstances, certainly.”

“In other words,” I said, “confess that I murdered Lily.”

George shambled his bear’s body over to me. The fatherly act. The close family friend. I knew what he’d say before he said it. “Alec, you know I’ll agree only to what’s best for you. Magee is one hundred percent right. He’s thought of the only way to get you off.”

“Get out!” I said. “Both of you!”

George’s small eyes blinked in pain. “Alec, as your attorneys—”

“I don’t want lawyers who are convinced I’m guilty. Get out!”

He turned to Magee for help, and the great lawyer gave me his smooth smile. “Naturally he’s upset, Winkler. He’ll be more reasonable tomorrow. Goodbye, my boy.”

“Don’t come back!” I flung after them.

For a long time I stood looking at the door after he closed it. My teeth were chattering. I gritted them and threw myself face down on the cot. The walls of the cell closed in on me. I could not breathe.

… They returned the next day. I had told the turnkey not to let them in, but he did. I lay on my cot and stared up at the ceiling and pretended not to hear them as they talked down at me. As a matter of fact, I heard very little of what they said. After a while they left.

***

Kerry Nugent came in briskly.

He grinned down at the chessboard on the chair.

“What’s the problem?” he asked.

“White to mate in four moves.”

He studied the board. “You’re even better than I think you are if you can do it.”

“I have plenty of time,” I said.

“I guess you have.” He sprawled down at the foot of the cot and nonchalantly dug out his pipe and pouch. It was all as casual as a visit to my bunk after we’d slept off a mission.

You may remember a photo in Life of a square-jawed, rugged-faced bomber pilot standing under a wing of a B-29 Superfortress in an India base. That was Captain Kerry Nugent. The moment the photographer’s eyes fell on him he tabbed Kerry as the idealized type of grim and nerveless American manhood who was bringing death and destruction to the enemy.

“How are the ribs?” I asked.

“As good as new, practically, except that I’m still taped up like a Prussian general in a corset.” His face clouded. “And stop talking like a heel about it. Miriam says you’re shooting a line that you lost the plane.”

“I did.”

“I’ll break your damn neck if you don’t cut it out.” Kerry sat up. “What the hell! I ought to have my head examined for bringing it up. How about a game of chess?”

“Your time will be up in a few minutes.”

“Not for Mrs. Nugent’s boy. I slipped the turnkey a five spot. That ought to be good for a couple of hours. Give me a knight and a bishop and I’ll try to make a game of it.”

I dumped the chessmen into their box. “I don’t want my mind taken off anything. I want to talk. How did you happen to show up at Lily’s place only a few minutes after I got there?”

His right cheek ticked. It was an old sign of annoyance.

“Why kick it around? Forget about her. She got what she deserved.”

“Why did you go to Lily’s?”

Noisily he drew flame into his pipe. “Miriam sent me. I’m a good soldier. When a lovely lady gives orders, I obey without question.”

“That’s no answer.”

“I suppose it isn’t,” Kerry said, suddenly grave. “I’m not quite straight on it myself. I’d gone to New York for a couple of days. I got home around eight and my mother told me that Miriam had phoned earlier; that you were expected home that day. I called up Helen and she’d heard from her father that you were back and she wanted to see you too, so after I ate I picked her up and we drove over.”

“You and Helen Spencer,” I said. “That’s something new.”

***

He grinned shyly. “About six days. Well, you know how you acted when we drove up and saw you coming out of the driveway. We drove on to the house and found everybody out on the porch talking about you.”

“So I broke up the card game?” I said.

“You sure did. I heard Mr. Spencer ask Ursula if she wanted to resume. She shook her head and stood looking out at the road. Then Miriam pulled me aside and told me what had happened. It didn’t sound like much to me. Why shouldn’t a guy raise hell when he isn’t told where his wife is? Why shouldn’t he dash off to her? But Miriam said I hadn’t seen the way you looked and acted. She was plenty worried. She gave me the idea that the place for you was a strait jacket, or anywhere but with a wife who’d been playing you dirty.”

He paused and then added: “That’s throwing it at you bluntly, but you wanted it.”

“You’re doing all right. Go on.”

“That’s about all. I argued for a while. You had every right to go dashing to your wife’s arms. Then Ursula joined the argument. I was your bosom pal; we’d faced life and death together; you’d resent my horning in on your affairs less than anybody else. That line. They weren’t sure what I should do when I caught up with you. I guess sort of hang around to keep you out of trouble and bring you back to the old homestead if Lily spat in your face, as they more or less expected. So I went.”

“Where was Sheriff Dowie?”

“He’d driven off. So had Bevis and his old man. Maybe George Winkler too; I don’t remember. But when I left, all I noticed on the porch were three women—Helen and Miriam and Ursula.”

“I walked all the way,” I said. “Why didn’t you reach Lily’s before I did?”

“That’s why I’m kicking myself now. But I didn’t hanker to barge in on you two in a fond embrace. My idea was to catch up to you on the road and maybe talk to you and calm you down or go to Lily’s with you if you didn’t object strenuously. So I crawled along the road in my car looking for you. When I reached the head of James Street, I decided that you couldn’t have walked there so soon or even run there and that I must have missed you on the way.”

“I cut across the golf course.”

“Hell! I should have thought of that. I drove back slowly, still looking for you. When I reached the bottom of Mandolin Hill, I turned around and tried again, figuring that somehow I’d passed you up in the darkness. This tune I went all the way to Lily’s. I saw a car parked outside—Dowie’s it turned out—and decided that if she was having company, why not me too?”

***

I sat on the other end of the cot fingering the chessmen in the box on my knees. It was a cheap wooden set. The black king had lost his cross and a white rook was minus a couple of turrets. Ursula had kept my good sets at home; this one would do for jail.

“Had you seen Lily before that?” I asked.

“Since my return home?” Kerry appeared to be smoking matches instead of tobacco. “Once. My second day in. Paid my respects to my pal’s wife. Told her you were okay and would be home any day. Drank a pair of cocktails she fixed and said so long. One of those duty calls. You know I didn’t care one bit for her.”

“You did that night we met her for the first time in New York.”

“Oh, then. She was a lass with plenty of pulchritude in a low-cut dress. Something to try to make. You did and I didn’t, so that was that. Besides, you married her, and that was okay by me, until what she did to you when we were in India. From then on she was marked lousy in my book.”

“How did she sound when you told her I was coming home?”

“Drop it, Alec. She was no good. It s not the thing to say about a pal’s wife, so in India I kept my Ups buttoned. But now I’m telling you.” He twisted on the cot to face me directly. This might hurt, but I got the impression that for all she cared you could rot in India.”

“It doesn’t hurt,” I said. “I’m sorry that she’s dead, but that’s all.”

“So forget her.”

“I doubt if the State of New York will let me.”

Kerry groped in his pockets for matches. I tossed him mine.

“I could hand you a lot of boloney about that,” he said after he had a light “but I won’t. I had a talk with George Winkler this morning. He’s plenty worried about the trial, especially because you refuse to be sensible.”

“I don’t want to discuss it.”

Winkler is one of the people who would give their right arm for you. He knows what he’s doing ”

“No.”

“Alec, you don’t know everything. If it came to taking a three-star fix, I’d back you against any navigator in the world. But this is law.”

“If that’s all you have to talk about,” I said, “you’d better go.”

His pipe stem made bubbling noises.

“I ought to push your teeth in,” he said after a while. “But it’s your life. Throw it away and the hell with you. Change your mind about a game?”

I submitted. We sat at either end of the cot with the board between us. I gave him a bishop and a knight, but ordinarily he needed more than that. Not today. I barely managed to squeeze out a draw.

***

Miriam came the day that Japan offered to surrender.

“Did you hear the news?” she said as soon as the door closed behind her.

“The turnkey told me. A lot of airmen I know are going to do a lot of celebrating at the thought of coming home.” I felt my teeth in my lower lip. “I was the lucky one. I beat them back to the peace and security and comfort of home.”

She moved all the way into the cell. She hadn’t very far to go. As usual, she wore white. She knew what it did for her black hair and eyes and dark skin. This time it was a white shantung suit with a black blouse. Very snappy. And her manner fitted the outfit. Calculatedly cool and casual. Chin up and a forced smile. Carefully ignore the locked door and the gray walls too close together and the single gash of window.

“The surrender isn’t official yet,” she said, still topically conversational. “Everybody is praying it will be.” She handed me a bulging paper bag. “Brownies which I baked for you this morning. With raisins, the way you like them.”

At the last sentence her voice betrayed her. It started to quiver, and suddenly tears brightened her eyes. She stepped past me and dropped limply into the chair.

Visits were too few and precious to be thrown away with weeping over me. I could do my own weeding when I was alone. So I sat down on the cot and tried to bring up a subject which would interest her more than I did. “Made up your mind about Bevis Spencer?”

“How can I think about it at a time like this?” She gave me her profile. She didn’t look well. Too much cheekbone showing. “Alec, why don’t you let your lawyers help you?”

“Because I don’t want lawyers who are convinced I’m guilty.”

“They don’t. George Winkler told me—”

“So he sent you to talk me into it?” I said.

“We all want to help you.”

“Sure,” I said. “Like you tried to shelter me from my wife.”

“That was a mistake. We should have overlooked everything Lily did until you got home.”

“And now you all believe I’m a murderer and you’re anxious to overlook that. You don’t shy away from me in horror. You’re loyal to the bitter end. And I’m not even grateful.”

“We don’t want gratitude. We want you back with us.”

There was no point in chasing the subject around. I dug into the paper bag and pulled out a brownie. Miriam couldn’t cook as well as Ursula—nobody could—but she could bake rings around her. “They’re wonderful,” I said and offered her the bag. “Thanks a lot.”

She took one and sat nibbling it. Her eyes were far away. “Alec,” she said remotely, “you must have loved Lily very much.”

“Did I?” I let the idea simmer before I spoke again. “I don’t think so. I hardly knew her. Six days in all, only three of them married to her. Those were fine days. I was going overseas, and I guess they would have been fine with almost any attractive woman with whom—” I stopped.

“I’m a big girl now,” Miriam said into her brownie. “I understand. Please go on.”

“Yes. And after that I was a million miles away and she was a woman to remember and dream about. If I was in love, it was with a memory.”

“Alec, did you kill her?”

***

You had to hand it to Miriam. She at least came right out with it. Nobody else had asked me except the district attorney and the police. The others skirted around it, pretending to assume that I hadn’t when they believed the opposite.

“No,” I said.

She nodded. “You wouldn’t lie about it if you had. Of course I believe you.” But what was believing? You thought you did and you said you did, but that was just emotion. Cold reason didn’t concur.

I took another brownie. “Did you send Kerry after me that night?”

“Yes. You frightened me. If Kerry had only met you! I mean, he would have gone there with you and he would have been a witness that you hadn’t done it. Or if George had met you on the way.”

“Did you send George also?”

“Only Kerry. The game broke up and we all stood on the porch for a few minutes. George had already driven away when Kerry left. The thing is that George lives on James Street, only a few hundred feet from Lily’s bungalow.”

“I saw him put a light on when I passed his house.”

“He was so close,” she said. “He blames himself now for not having waited for you on James Street or for not looking in on Lily. But how could he have known?”

“Did everybody leave the house after the game?”

“Well, Mr. Dowie was the first to drive away. Bevis drove his father home and came back a little later. Helen waited for Kerry to return. He was gone for more than an hour and then he brought the terrible news.” She put a hand on my knee. “Alec, why don’t you try to save yourself?”

“Back to the lawyers,” I grunted.

“They don’t want you to confess or anything like that. That would be stupid. George merely wants you to listen to him and Mr. Magee.”

“I’ve heard what they have to say.”

“You have to have a lawyer,” she said urgently. “I understand that you can’t plead guilty of murder even if you want to, so there has to be a trial and a defense. If George and Mr. Magee aren’t your lawyers, the court will assign one to you. Do you think you will be better off with a strange lawyer? George says that the district attorney is willing to accept a second-degree murder plea and that any other lawyer will snatch at it. George won’t and you know it. He won’t stop at anything to get you off free.”

She did it very well. George Winkler must have coached her.

“The district attorney asked me to testify against you,” she went on. “He has an idea that before you went down to the cardroom I told you Lily was unfaithful to you and that that was what made you so excited. I went to George and he told the district attorney that I would be a hostile witness and talked him out of a subpoena. So you see, George continues to work for you.”

“That’s why the court hasn’t assigned another lawyer to you.”

I sat hunched over on the cot with the bag of brownies between my palms. This was my third week of being shut in here with nothing to do but think.

I’d been dealt a busted straight and the state held a pat hand and it was a pot I had to take or die. I was scared. I hadn’t stopped being scared for a single minute since the state police lieutenant had told me I was under arrest.

The door creaked open. “Time’s up, lady,” the turnkey said.

Miriam sent him a frantic look, then turned her dark, wide eyes to me. “Alec, at least let George and Mir. Magee talk to you.”

I stood up and so did she and together we walked the few steps to the door.

“Alec, please!” she said.

“All right, send them over,” I told her wearily.

***

George Winkler said: “Get the idea out of your head that we think you’re guilty. It’s only that the evidence is overwhelmingly against you, and we decided that there is only one way to get you off.”

“By sending me to an insane asylum,” I said.

“Nonsense. You misunderstood Magee. Even if that were the only way, we couldn’t bring it off. The D.A. would stop us cold by bringing in psychologists.”

“How will confessing to a crime I didn’t commit help me?”

“That’s not what we want either. All we ask is that you don’t say anything before or during the trial. Sit tight. Leave it to us.”

“I’ll tell the truth over and over if I’m asked, by the D.A. or anybody else.”

Robin Magee left the wall against which he had been leaning. “By all means, my boy. The truth. In my twenty-two years of law practice I have lost only one client to the electric chair, and I must say he deserved it.”

“I’d as soon take the chair as a jail sentence.”

“You haven’t a thing to worry about,” Magee assured me placidly. “But I can promise to get you off free only if you don’t interfere with my line of defense.”

“Which is that I didn’t do it.”

“Certainly. Now, just relax. That’s all we ask of you.”

They prepared to leave, but I wasn’t through with them. “George, did you hire private detectives?”

He looked blank for a moment. “Oh, yes, detectives. That’s not necessary. Magee has a couple of top-notch investigators in his office.”

“Are they doing anything?” I asked. “Have they learned anything?”

“If anybody learns anything, they will,” Magee said. “They are digging into Lily’s life.”

I nodded. “That’s the right angle. Maybe it was a boyfriend who wanted her to go away with him when he heard I was coming home and he killed her when she turned him down.”

They were not impressed. Magee said: “That is a possibility, but the coincidence is somewhat too pat. I mean, the murder occurring only a few minutes after you arrived, after having left your house in a state of—uh—high excitement.”

We were back where we had been. They hadn’t changed their minds; they were merely applying soft-soap. And who could blame them? My hand couldn’t be worse and I couldn’t improve it.

“Listen,” I said. “A couple of days ago I remembered something. When I started down James Street that night, a car approached from the direction of Lily’s bungalow. I thought the driver might be able to tell me where she lived and I flagged him. The car was going very fast on that bumpy road. It didn’t even slow down.”

George Winkler’s bright little eyes glittered. “You think it was the murderer fleeing from the scene of the crime?”

“It could have been.”

“How do you know the car was coming from Lily’s house?” Magee argued. “You say you were at the head of the road. It might have been coming from any of the other houses or through from the other end of the road.”

“The car almost ran me down,” I said.

“A fleeing murderer would be panicky if anybody tried to stop him.”

“Did you see the license number? Do you remember the make of car?”

I shook my head. “The car meant nothing to me then. It might still mean nothing, but it’s worth looking into.”

“We certainly shall.” Robin Magee glanced at his watch. “Take it easy, my boy. I promise you again that you have nothing to worry about.”

More soft-soap. After they left, I stood at the window and thought about the car. It couldn’t be traced. It was just a car, any car, passing in the night, and there was only my word that it had passed.

My word wasn’t good for anything. To everybody it was the word of a murderer.
