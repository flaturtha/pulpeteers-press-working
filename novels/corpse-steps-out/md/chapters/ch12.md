### Chapter 12

Jake began what he was to remember later as one of the most terrible days of a lifetime by meeting Nelle and Helene for breakfast at Ricketts. The two girls were waiting for him when he arrived, exchanging confidences like lifelong friends.

"Anything happen on Erie Street last night?" he asked Helene, sliding into his chair.

"Not unless you count Molly waking me at three this morning to come downstairs and drink beer," she reported. Adding, "It was terrible beer, but I met a lot of interesting people."

A black-haired waitress came and took their order.

"Eight-thirty is a lousy time for breakfast, if you ask me," Nelle grumbled, "audition or no audition."

"You're showing up at St. John's office at ten," Jake reminded her. "You're going to be a nice mild little girl and keep your temper, too. I'll meet you there. First, I've got to deliver a copy of your contract to Malone, so he can fly up to Brule with it."

Nelle said, "I hope to heaven he finds those guys."

"He will," Jake said confidently. "When Malone starts out to do something, he does it. St. John will probably get his contract signed, sealed, and delivered at one second after six, official Western Union time. But in the meantime Malone will have the other contract signed before six. St. John's contract won't be worth the match to set it afire." He hoped it was true.

"Isn't he wonderful!" Nelle said. "If it weren't for Tootz, I'd cut you out, Helene, and marry him myself."

"You couldn't do it," Jake said. "It's bad enough to be your manager."

She frowned. "But Jake. Even if St. John doesn't get away with selling me to Givvus, suppose he still makes me sign the personal-management contract?"

"He can't do it," Jake said. "He's got your letters, sure. He can hold them over you, sure. But he can't do more than bluff. Because he knows that to use them would ruin you as a radio property, and after all, no matter who you're sold to, you're his agency's property. Your show is the backbone of the whole damn radio department, of which he's the head. No, he can't use those letters and he knows it." "I hope you're right."

"I know damned well I'm right. You go through this audition today like a good girl and behave yourself. And then when this is settled, maybe Helene and I can find time to get married."

"Maybe," Helene said gloomily.

"I'll give you a special wedding present to make up for all this," Nelle said. "I don't know what yet, but something."

"How about the Michigan Avenue Bridge?" Jake suggested.

He managed to keep them from talking about the audition until breakfast was over. As he called for the check, Helene lit a cigarette, looked reflectively at the litter of cigarette stubs, matches, and crumpled cigarette packages in the ashtray, and laid her lighted match in the center of it. A sudden blaze leaped up.

The black-haired waitress came running.

"Don't mind her," Jake said, in a whisper that could be heard clearly across the street. "She's a pyromaniac. A firebug. She's all right every other way, but she's a pyromaniac."

"Yes," Nelle added in an equally stentorian whisper, "we have to watch her every minute."

Helene busied herself with her compact and pretended not to hear.

"Only last month,
"Jake finished, 'She burned down the railway station in Oshkosh, and it cost us a fortune to hush things up.'

As they waited for the change, they could see the black-haired waitress talking in low tones to the other waitresses, who stared with scandalized and fascinated eyes at Helene.

'See,' Jake said, 'now you’re famous. That’s what having a press agent means.'

Helene closed her compact with a snap. 'You’re going to be sorry for this,' she prophesied gloomily.

A few minutes after ten, Jake walked into the ornate reception room of the agency. Malone was on his way north with the contract. Helene was to meet him at the studio later in the morning.

'Is Mr. St. John in?'

The pretty girl at the desk looked up. 'Oh, Mr. Justus. Thank God. You’d better go right in.'

Jake went down a long corridor, stopped before a desk where a blonde secretary busied herself with pages of reports.

'Morning, dear. How does your boss feel this morning?'

The blonde girl looked up grimly. 'He was peevish when he came in. It’s his bunions again. They’re always worse on hot days like this. I tell him it’s the shoes he wears, but he can’t seem to find any that help, poor man. And then Miss Brown came in. She doesn’t seem to feel so good either. You’d better go on in.'

Through the glass door, he could hear Nelle’s voice raised to a shrieking pitch.

'No,' he said, shaking his head, 'no, she doesn’t seem to feel so good.'

He opened the glass door just in time to have a script, thrown from across the room, catch him full in the face. 'Pick that up, Nelle,' St. John said coldly.

Jake closed the door. 'Is everybody happy?'

'Jake, tell him to go to hell.'

'Go to hell,' Jake said agreeably, reaching for his cigarettes.

'I asked you to pick up the script, Nelle,' St. John said.

Jake started to reach for the script, but Nelle was ahead of him. She picked it up, tore it very slowly and deliberately into shreds, dropped the shreds on the floor, and ground them under her slender heels. Then without a word, she stalked out, slamming the door with a bang that set all the windows rattling.

'Nelle doesn’t like the script, eh?' Jake said, lighting a cigarette.

'That’s my impression,' St. John said crisply. He scowled. 'She ought to be made to come back and close that door properly.' Jake wondered if St. John had ever taught school.

'It’s none of my business,' Jake said easily. 'Fight the script out between you. But if you want to get a good job from her this afternoon, go a little easy. Nelle has to be pampered a little.'

'She’s had too much pampering,' St. John said nastily. 'That’s the whole trouble with her.'

Jake sat down on a corner of the big desk, swung one long leg back and forth, and said very casually, 'It’s still none of my business, but why don’t you leave Nelle’s show with Goldman, who won’t buy anything else, sell some other show to Givvus, and have two big shows on the air instead of one.'

'Givvus also won’t buy anything else,' the agency man said.

Jake looked very intently at his left shoe. 'In that case, why go to all the bother of holding an audition for him?'

'Purely a formality,' St. John said.

Jake nodded. 'Well, I said it was none of my business. A job is a job to me. Let me know what you want Nelle to do, and I'll see that she does it.' He looked up at the pale, narrow face across the desk and thought what fun it would be to muss it up.

'I appreciate your cooperation,' St. John said. 'Let’s go on to the studio. I trust Nelle will be there when we arrive.'

'She will be,' Jake said, hoping it was the truth.

St. John called the blonde secretary, gave orders regarding a dozen or more small details of the day’s activities, reached for his shoes under the desk, and put them on with a wince. For the barest moment, Jake saw him as a tired, exasperated man whose feet hurt.

They rode to the studio in silence.

Nelle was there, so was Helene. St. John looked at the latter disapprovingly."
This is supposed to be a secret audition.”

“Miss Brand is my confidential secretary,” Jake told him. He went on into the control room. Schultz was there, gloomily gnawing an apple.

“What’s this secret audition about?”

“Don’t ask me,” Jake said. “Agency doing.”

Schultz grunted.

Oscar Jepp’s enormous bulk suddenly darkened the room. “Who the hell wrote this script?”

“Don’t ask me,” Jake said easily. “Maybe St. John wrote it himself.”

Oscar snorted. “I don’t think anybody wrote it. I think it was found floating up the Chicago River in a beer bottle.”

He rounded up his cast and went into the studio. Helene came into the control room and sat down by Jake’s side. Rehearsal got under way.

It was worse than any rehearsal Jake could remember, and that, he reflected, was saying a great deal. There was no single line of the script that met Oscar Jepp's approval. Lou Silver had to break a date with a new girlfriend to attend the audition, and he hated everybody. There was an obbligato passage in Nelle’s first song which she fumbled on every attempt. The sound-effect man’s wife was in the process of having a baby, and whenever a sound cue appeared in the script, it turned out that the prospective father had gone to phone the hospital. Bob Bruce had a bad hangover.

During the first half-hour, Nelle burst into tears and walked out of the studio. Through the loudspeaker, Jake could hear Oscar saying anxiously, “Don’t worry, she’ll sing it all right when the time comes.”

During the second half-hour, Bob Bruce went through a brief period of being unable to pronounce “broadcasting” any other way than “croadbasting,” and demoralized the entire cast.

After a horrible hour, a timing rehearsal was called, and it was found that the show ran six and three-quarter minutes overtime.

St. John and Oscar retired for a profane and vituperative session of shortening the script, and Jake sent downstairs for coffee and sandwiches for the cast. He looked for Nelle, found her distractedly pacing the hall. Helene slipped an arm around the singer’s shoulders.

“I suppose I'll live through this,” Nelle said unhappily.

They strolled into the reception room. Someone had left an early American lying on one of the chairs. Jake picked it up, glanced at it.

“Oh God,” Jake said. “It couldn’t be!”
