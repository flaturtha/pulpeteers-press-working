### Chapter 15
## The Mic is Hot

A page boy came running and helped St. John to his feet.

“I'm sorry,” Jake said. “It was one of those irresistible impulses.”

“That’s all right, Mr. Justus,” said the page boy soothingly. “Those things will happen now and then.”

John St. John glared at them over a handkerchief.

“I'm not going to forget this, Jake Justus!”

“Not for a while, you’re not,” Jake agreed happily, looking at the reddening handkerchief, and the damage done on St. John’s slender and aristocratic nose.

“I always say,” Helene observed, watching St. John’s stiff back disappear through the door, “there’s nothing like a good old-fashioned brawl to clear the atmosphere.”

Jake flicked imaginary soil from his hands. “Now that’s over, we’ll have dinner.”

“How can you!” Nelle said weakly. “How can you eat or talk or do anything normal, after—after a day like this!”

“We men of iron,” Jake said in his best lecture-platform voice, “become accustomed to the trivial frictions of life.”

Even this didn’t get so much as a snort out of Nelle and Helene.

They had dinner, doing their best to keep up a conversation. It was not wholly successful.

“I wonder if they’ve found him yet,” Helene said over the coffee.

“Found who?”

“The—I mean, Mr. Givvus.”

Nelle shuddered. “It was awful. I mean, walking in there and finding somebody murdered.”

“You ought to be getting used to it,” Jake said. “This is the second time it’s happened.”

“Jake!”

“We’ll take her home,” Helene said, “my home, I mean. Then she can feel as bad as she wants to.”

Jake paid the check and they walked out to the car.

“We’ll take her home,” Jake said, “but there’s no sense to her feeling bad. Naturally, murder is bound to be a little upsetting, but you can get used to anything. And these murders all seem to be doing Nelle a lot of good.”

They stopped at the drugstore to replenish the liquor supply, then drove to the Erie Street building.

Halfway up the stairs, Nelle stopped. “Jake. Not that apartment.”

“Yes,” Jake said, taking her arm. “That apartment. And quit shivering. It doesn’t look anything the same.”

Helene stopped suddenly. “Oh Lord. I forgot.”

“What did you forget?” Jake asked. “I’ve got the bottle.”

“I forgot that—I mean, I forgot it was the same apartment that—"

“Shut up,” Jake said, “both of you.”

“Oh Jake,” Helene said, “can’t you sympathize with her?”

“I can,” Jake said, “but I’m damned if I think it would be good for her. Go on, open the door.” He slipped an arm around Nelle’s waist as they walked into the room.

She looked around a little timorously. “It doesn’t look the same. Everything’s gone. Everything of his, I mean.” She began to cry.

Jake steered her to the davenport, sat down beside her, and pulled her head down on his shoulder. “Go ahead. Cry all you want. You might as well get it over with.”

“I just thought,” she sobbed, “about all the times...
I used to come here and how everything looked then, and then I didn’t come here anymore but I knew everything was just the same, and he was here, and now he’s dead, and everything of his is gone, and it’s all so different.”

“Sure,” Jake said, patting her. “Go ahead and cry.”

“It was just as if I didn’t really know what had happened, because so many other things kept on happening, but walking in here like this made me realize everything all of a sudden, Jake, and it’s awful.”

“A lot of things are awful,” Jake said, “but you get used to them.”

“I won’t ever get used to this, Jake. I’ll just keep thinking about walking in here and finding him dead, even when I'm an old woman and all my teeth fall out and nobody likes me anymore, and I’ll never forget any of it, Jake, and I'll never be happy again as long as I live, never, never, never.”

“Cheer up,” Jake said, “you haven’t got hay fever.”

She stopped crying and looked at him. “What about hay fever?”

“I mean,” Jake said, “think how terrible it would be if all this happened to you, and you had all these troubles, and then on top of everything else, you had hay fever. That would really be awful.”

She was silent for a minute, finally managed a smile.

“Maybe I ought to have a drink.”

“Maybe you ought to wash your face first,” Jake said.

She thought about it. “I guess I will.”

Jake strolled out to the kitchen where Helene was busy with glasses and the bottle of rye. “I’m glad that’s over.”

“I don’t know but what I do approve your variety of sympathy after all,” Helene observed. “Maybe it was a good idea to bring her here. She’s going to feel a lot better from now on.” She carried glasses and the bottle into the living room, poured drinks and set them on the table, and sat down on the floor.

Nelle returned, her face duly washed.

“Well,” Jake said, putting a glass in Nelle’s hand, “now perhaps we can try to dope this thing out.”

“Jake,” Nelle asked, “who shot Mr. Givvus?”

“Did you?” he asked, very calmly and quietly.

She stared at him. “Jake, you really think that I did?”

He avoided her eyes. “Well after all—you were there. You had the best reason for it; as far as I know.”

“Jake, don’t be a fool,” Helene said furiously. “You know she didn’t shoot him.”

He sighed. “I don’t know anything. She might have, and could have. That’s why I was so ding-danged anxious to get the body away from there.”

“But I didn’t, Jake,” Nelle said, desperation in her voice.

“All right, we’ll go on the assumption that you didn’t, and God help you if you’re lying about it. If you didn’t—who would want to shoot Mr. Givvus?”

“A question,” Helene said. “Who at the audition would know him well enough to want to shoot him?”

“As far as I know,” Jake said thoughtfully, “the only person there who knew him was St. John. How about it, Nelle?”

“You’re probably right. I met him once, months ago. He’s from Philadelphia. I don’t imagine one solitary soul at the broadcasting studio knew him, except perhaps for a casual introduction. What’s more, it being a secret audition, nobody outside the cast and ourselves knew he was there—and I’m sure nobody in the cast knew him.”

Jake sighed. “That leaves us you and St. John,” he said. “And God knows, St. John wouldn’t have shot him. Not after arranging a secret audition of a show to sell him and going through all a secret audition means—and on a day when his bunions hurt, too. No, even if St. John had wanted to shoot him, he’d have let him hear the audition first.”

“And that leaves me,” Nelle said slowly. “But Jake, I didn’t.”

“All right,” Jake said, “let it go at that. There’s one very pertinent fact that you yourself innocently pointed out when we found the body. Remember? You said—‘But nobody would shoot a prospective sponsor. He must have been mistaken for someone else.”

“He was sitting with his back to the door,” Nelle said slowly, “with just the back of his head showing. And the lights weren’t any t
The room was dim, as intended for the client, but it was too bright. They were supposed to focus on auditions, not timetables.

"Who could he have been mistaken for?"

"Who else would be present during the audition?"

"Nobody except St. John," Nelle replied, fixing her gaze on Jake. "But Jake, this implies someone wants to kill St. John. We've been assuming St. John shot Paul March!"

"Perhaps he did," Jake suggested. "But that doesn't rule out other potential murderers. Today's incident, assuming it was one, might be entirely separate."

"Who might want to kill St. John?" Helene inquired.

"Anyone who knew him," Nelle retorted sharply.

"That's what you said about Paul March. Not very helpful," Jake remarked. "The client's room is down the hall from the studio and away from the reception room. Before or during the audition, anyone involved with the show could have entered and shot him. Even Essie St. John, who was waiting for audition news. I hope she's not there yet."

"Could Essie have shot Mr. Givvus, mistaking him for St. John?" Nelle pondered.

"If she did," Jake replied, "she might deserve another chance." Reflecting, he added, "It's odd no one heard the shot. It's odd no one heard it when Paul March was killed. Perhaps a silenced gun was used. But that would suggest the same culprit, and there's no evident link between the two murders except Nelle."

"Jake," she implored, "I didn't."

"You've said that before," he reminded her.

Suddenly, the buzzer rang, startling them. Jake answered, discovering a call from Malone in Madison.

"Everything's sorted," Jake informed him. "Can't explain now, but you don't need to locate Goldman. Hurry back; we need you!"

"Why?" Malone asked.

"To be the best man at a wedding," Jake replied before hanging up.

As he ascended the stairs, thoughts raced through his mind about the journey to Crown Point the next day. A loud noise from apartment 215 interrupted his contemplation.

The door flung open, flooding the hall with people. A brunette grabbed Jake, asking about the noise.

"It came from in there," Jake pointed, dashing towards the source. "It was a gunshot!"
