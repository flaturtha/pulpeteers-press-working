### Chapter 26
## All Bets Are Off

Bob Bruce’s apartment was on the top floor of a building only a few blocks north of Erie Street, overlooking the lake. The handsome young announcer, his face pale with anxiety and loss of sleep, ushered them into a large living room that was a confused horror of modernistic furniture and paintings.

Essie St. John sat near the window on a contortion of chromium-plated gas pipe and pink leather.

“Fancy meeting you here!” Jake said pleasantly.

She had the appearance of one who has been holding back hysteria for unnumbered hours. At the sound of Jake’s voice, she immediately burst into frantic tears.

“Essie, please, darling, please, Essie,” Bob Bruce said, kneeling beside her.

She buried her face in her hands, shaking from head to foot. In a minute, Jake saw, she would begin screaming.

“Bob, where’s the bathroom?”

“In there.”

Jake soaked a towel in ice water, shoved Essie’s head back against his arm, and slapped her gently with the towel until she grew quiet. He could hear Malone out in the kitchen, making noises that indicated coffee was being made.

“Oh, Jake,” she said weakly. “I’m terribly sorry. I just couldn’t help it. I’ve been trying not to for so long, and then all of a sudden you were here, and I couldn’t help it.”

“Don’t apologize,” he said. “I often have that effect on people.” He sponged her face with the towel, lit a cigarette, and held it to her mouth. “You’d better powder your nose.”

She managed a faint and unconvincing smile.

“Now take a long breath and tell me what happened,” he said very calmly.

“Bob, you tell him. I can’t. I can’t talk about it.”

Bob Bruce wrinkled his good-looking face into an appalling scowl. “Jake, it’s a mess. A terrible mess.”

“You told me that over the phone, and I’ll take your word for it. What happened?”

“Well—last night Essie told me what she was going to do. You know what I mean. We—I—we had a date. Never mind that. Anyway, she told me. About the letters, and how she was going to get them. It’s all right—her telling me, I mean. She knew she could trust me.”

“Yes, yes, yes, yes,” Jake said, “but go on.”

“Well, I wasn’t going to let her go out there alone. Hardly. So I drove her out there. We went around the back way. Through the window, we could see St. John, slumped over in his chair. I waited in my car, and Essie went in by the back door.”

“Jake,” she interrupted in a little wail, “Jake, there wasn’t anything in the kitchen. Not anything. I don’t understand—”

“Never mind,” Jake said hastily, “tell the rest of it.”

Malone, standing in the doorway, signaled him to keep his mouth shut. He nodded almost imperceptibly.

“I went into the living room, and Jake—”

She stopped.

“Go on, Essie.”

“He was dead,” she said in a voice like a whispered scream.

Jake lit a cigarette very deliberately, counted five to himself, and said, “He was dead when you got there?”

“Yes. Yes, he was. I ran out to the car and told Bob. Then I thought about the letters. I thought about someone finding them, the police or someone. So I went back.”

He stared at her in amazement.

“I went back and—felt in his pocket—in all his pockets, Jake.”

“Good God, Essie!” He l
Jake looked at her admiringly.

“Jake, they weren’t there. They weren’t anywhere. Someone took them.”

There was a long, terrible silence.

“I guess the coffee’s done,” Malone said at last. He went into the kitchen, returned with cups and the coffee pot, poured out coffee, and passed it around. No one spoke.

“Oh, Jake,” Essie said frantically, setting down her cup. “Who shot him? Who shot Paul March and how did his body get there? Who took the letters and where are they? What are we going to do? Oh, Jake, what are we going to do?”

Jake crushed out his cigarette. “Essie, I don’t know who shot whom, or why, and I don’t know where the letters are. Let Malone and I worry about those things. But if you had the courage enough to go back in that room last night, you’ve got the courage to do what you’ve got to do now.” He thought for a moment. “Will your sister have had sense enough—”

Bob Bruce spoke up. “I phoned her just before you got here. I just said, ‘Do you know where Essie is?’ She knew what I meant, and she said that Essie had been there all night, and was sleeping. She said no one had tried to locate her out there yet, but if anyone did, she’ll tell them Essie was sleeping.”

“Good,” Jake said, “evidently the whole family thinks on its feet. Where’s your car, Bob?”

“Parked right around the corner, on Pearson Street.”

“All right. You drive Essie out to her sister’s. Pray that no one gets a look at her on the way. Then get away from there as fast as you can and spend the rest of the day giving the impression you don’t know a thing about this. Essie, you and your sister make double sure that alibi of yours is foolproof. And then, by God, you take a sedative and get into bed. Take something that will keep you asleep all day. I don’t imagine you had any sleep last night.”

She shook her head. “I’ve just been sitting here by the window, trying to think, and finally all I could think of was for Bob to find you.”

“Well, you stay asleep all day. I’ll send a doctor friend of mine out to see you late this afternoon, and he’ll give you something to make you keep on sleeping, and he’ll announce to the police that you’re in a state of complete collapse, not fit to be questioned. By the time they do get to question you, either you’ll have your nerves in good shape so you can stand up under it, or the murderer will have been found and it won’t matter.”

“All right, Jake.” She drew a long, shuddering breath. “I’ll do just as you say.”

“Good girl.” He patted her shoulder.

Malone spoke up from his post by the doorway.

“Jake’s advice is good, and be sure you follow it. But, just between ourselves, and just to keep the record clear, did you shoot him?”

She looked up, wide-eyed. “No.”

Bob Bruce said angrily, “Of course she didn’t.”

“Don’t mind me,” Malone said. “I don’t care. I was just curious. But if the whole story comes out, your part of it is going to look fishy as hell.”

Essie St. John spoke slowly and deliberately, “No, I didn’t shoot him. But so many times I’ve wished I had nerve enough to do it. Now he’s dead and I’m free. I can’t believe it.”

Bob Bruce knelt beside her again, put an arm around her gently. “You’ll believe it in time. The whole thing is going to seem like a nightmare that’s all done with. And when it’s all over and forgotten, and we’re married, perhaps I can make you happy enough to make up for all of it.”

“Well, well,” Jake said, “what a wonderful time for a proposal.”

No one paid any attention to him. Least of all, Essie St. John. She stared at the young announcer. “But Bob. You mean you really want to marry me?”

“Of course I do, you nitwit,” Bob said almost crossly. “I’ve been in love with you for weeks—months—hell, I’ve been in love with you forever.”

“But Bob,” she said again. “But I’m so—homely!” Tears trembled in her eyes again.

“Don’t be such a sap,” he said, and this time his voice was really cross. “You’re the most beautiful woman I ever saw, and you know it.”
Jake could tell that he meant it from the bottom of his heart.

“Very pretty,” Malone said, “and for the love of God, get out of here and on your way.” His voice was unexpectedly gentle.

Out on the sidewalk, Jake said to Malone, “That reminds me, I’m going to be married myself. Do you think we can make it today?”

“I doubt it,” Malone said. “At least, your bride-to-be has to stay hidden until I get this arson charge off her neck.” He sighed. “Arson, body snatching, obstruction of justice, falsifying evidence, and resisting arrest. Resisting an officer in the attempt to do his duty—hell, a whole squad car full of officers.”

“Not only that,” Jake said, “Helene also drove through a stop light.”

“All she has to do now is slap a policeman,” the lawyer said gloomily, “and she’ll get life.”

“Malone, who shot St. John?”

“I don’t know, but I hope his wife didn’t. That looks like the start of a beautiful romance.”

“She said she didn’t shoot him,” Jake observed. “Don’t you believe her?”

“I never believe anybody,” Malone said sourly. “I always expect people to lie to me. That’s how I always know exactly where I stand.”

“Just assuming for the moment that Essie is telling the truth,” Jake began.

Malone interrupted him. “By a strange coincidence, at least I hope it’s a coincidence, the person who benefits most by the death of Paul March and by the death of Mr. Givvus and now by the death of John St. John is none other than Nelle Brown.”

“Malone, you can’t think she’s guilty of murder.”

“Leave what I think out of this. I only hope the police don’t think she is.”

“Damn it,” Jake said crossly, “they can’t.”

“Who are you to tell what the police can or can’t do?” Malone said. “Hope for the best and keep your fingers crossed. And now, for the love of God, let’s have breakfast.”
