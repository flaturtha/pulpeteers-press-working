### Chapter 3
## Bloodstains and Bouquets

Jake told the taxi driver to go around Grant Park until further orders and to close the glass partition. Then he turned to Nelle, huddled in a corner. “Paul March had it coming to him, but why did you do it?”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she said sullenly.

He carefully unfolded the green chiffon handkerchief across her knee so that the stain showed darkly. She snatched it back from sight.

“What did you do with the gun, Nelle? I hope to heaven you pitched it in the river.”

“I never had a gun. I didn’t shoot him.”

He swore wearily and at length, without repeating himself.

“Jake, please believe me.”

“I don’t give a damn if you shot him or not. My job is to keep you out of trouble, and I’m going to do it. Don’t forget your contract is up for re-signing. It’s none of my business whether or not you shot the guy, but will you please tell me where you got the gun and what you did with it, and who might have seen you going there, so I’ll know just what I’ve got to do first?”

“But I didn’t shoot him, Jake. You’ve got to believe me. I was there tonight, yes. That’s right. But I didn’t shoot him.”

“You said...”
"That before," he said glumly.

"I went there. I'd written him some letters, last winter."

Jake asked, "Just how bad were they?"

"Well—pretty warm. He was a—oh, skip that. Anyway, he kept them. I should have known this was coming when he called up and tried to borrow money from me."

"Did he succeed?" Jake asked interestedly.

Her answer was brief, vituperative, and profane.

"Well," he said mildly, "I didn't think you would."

"I don't mind loaning money to a friend, but not to a skunk. Not after the way he treated me."

"I don't blame you," Jake said, "but go on. He had your letters. He tried to borrow money from you. Take it up from there."

"Jake, I said I should have seen this coming. Anyway, I heard from him today. He sent me a note. Offered to sell me the letters. You can imagine," she said with feeling, "just what would happen if Tootz should ever know about this."

"Tootz," Jake said, "or your adoring public."

"Oh, the hell with the public. Can't you think of anything else at a time like this? Well anyway, Jake, I wasn't going to kick in, not to that rat. I was going up there between shows and scare the everlasting goddamned living daylights out of him, and get my letters back without giving him a dime. I'd have done it too," she added thoughtfully, "if some bastard hadn't gotten there first and shot him."

Jake said scornfully, "Who would want to shoot him?" "Who wouldn't?" Nelle asked, just as scornfully.

He tried to think of an answer to that one, couldn't, and asked instead, "What did you do with the letters?" "I didn't do anything with them. I didn't find them." "What do you mean, you couldn't find them?" "I said what you heard. They weren't there." He murmured, "Good God!" under his breath, and snapped his cigarette out the cab window.

"Jake darling, I looked everywhere. I did everything but tear the paper off the walls. Those letters weren't anywhere in the place."

"But it don't make sense," he said stupidly. "Either he hadn't really kept them and was just trying to bluff me, or else somebody else has them now."

Jake inquired loudly of an unanswering and possibly disinterested providence why he had ever taken on the job of managing Nelle Brown.

Just the same, he looked at her with reluctant admiration. Between broadcasts she had gone to bluff a blackmailer into giving back the foolish letters she had written him, and had found the man dead. She had walked into what must have been an agonizingly familiar room and stumbled on the murdered body of a man she had been wildly in love with only a few months before. (Or had she found him alive and left him dead?) Whatever had happened, she had done a magnificent job of the rebroadcast, as smooth as though nothing, not even the most trivial thing, had disturbed her.

Nelle Brown chose that moment to hurl herself at his shoulder, bury her head in it, and begin to cry, noisily and childishly.

"He used to be so sweet to me, Jake. Just sweet. Good-for-nothing louse if there ever was one. Can't you imagine what it was like, walking in there tonight? It was wintertime when—remember? I used to stop in there and he'd have a fire going in the fireplace, and he always took my galoshes off for me, and I'd watch the snow going down past the window. Everything looked just the way it always did, with the little chromium ashtray on the end table, the one we got with cigarette coupons. And he was there on the kitchen floor, dead. All bloody, Jake. I used to be so happy with him. Remember how awful it was when Joe McIvers had him fired, and he told me that it was all just so he'd get the job of producing the show? He hadn't really cared about me, he just wanted my show to do. Remember how you sat up with me for three nights in a row, and how we thought I'd never get sobered up for rehearsal, and that terrible Turkish-bath place you took me to? I could have sworn he was in love with me. Oh, Jake, he couldn't have said some of the things he said."
"And not meant them.”

Jake held her very gently for a few minutes and let her talk on and on, until at last she sat bolt upright and said in a calm, perfectly clear voice, “I wonder where in hell those letters are now.”

He looked at her and shook his head wearily. No, he would never quite understand her. No one ever would.

“And all that money, Jake. Where did he get all that money? I didn’t give it to him.”

“Somebody did,” Jake said thoughtfully. “Why? Nobody would lend him that much.” He considered it for a minute, and said, “He sold the letters to somebody else. Or he was blackmailing somebody else and somebody shot him. Or—but why shoot him and then not take the money back?” He sighed. “He was blackmailing somebody we’ll call A, and somebody we will call B came in and shot him. This gets too damned complicated, Nelle. You must have shot him yourself.”

“Go to hell!”

He said slowly, “Aside from the problem of the letters, you may have been seen going there tonight. Or somebody may remember you used to spend a lot of time with him last winter. I jumped to the conclusion you’d shot him the minute I saw him, and it’s just possible, baby, a jury of twelve good men may jump to the same conclusion.”

“No, Jake! Oh no!”

“It does happen to people,” he told her calmly. “And even if that eventually doesn’t come about, you may still get messed up in a nasty, sordid murder case, and you know what happens to people in radio when they get into things like that. Remember what happened to Annette just because she was named as correspondent in a very ugly divorce action. Swell little actress, Annette, and not a director in town will touch her with a ten-foot pole.”

“I know,” she said reflectively. “I paid Annette’s rent for her last week, and only God knows what she’s eating on.”

“Well,” he said, “there’s an old, old saying, baby. It might have happened to you.”

“And Tootz,” she said, her voice suddenly strained and harsh. “Tootz. If he knew. Oh, Jake, that would be awful. Jake, that mustn’t happen.”

“It may, when the police start nosing around in their horrid, inquisitive way,” Jake told her.

“Jake, I shouldn’t have called the police when I found him, should I?”

He leaned back against the cushions and talked emphatically to heaven about Nelle Brown.

“Hell,” she said, “nobody could be that stupid, at least I know I’m not.”

“The police will find out about it soon enough,” he said, “and without our help, too. Just pray they don’t learn that either of us dropped in there tonight, and you also might pray that whoever has those letters is a friend of yours.”

“What do you mean, Jake?”

“I mean that conceivably somebody murdered March for them in order to do the blackmailing himself. In which case this affair might run into money.”

“Money,” Nelle Brown said scornfully. “Who the devil cares about money?”

He reminded her briefly and untactfully that there had been days when she would have sold the flowers off her grandmother’s grave for the price of a cup of coffee and a hamburger.

She ignored him, and said, “But if whoever has those letters is a friend of mine—"

“Then Paul March may have been murdered to get you out of a jam.” He looked at his watch. “Listen, baby. We’ll cope with those things later. Right now, you’ve got to go to Max’s. Everybody from the show is going there, and you’re expected. You’ve got to give the impression that you don’t know what’s happened. Does Tootz think you’re coming home tonight?”

“No.”

“Date with Baby?”

“Yes.”

“Well, when Baby shows up, send him home as soon as you can. I’m not going to let you out of my sight until this breaks.” He tapped on the glass, told the driver to take them to Max’s. “I’ll get you out of this somehow, but you’ve got to do exactly as I tell you, every blessed minute.”

“I will, Jake.”

He felt agreeably sure he could depend on that.

At Max’s, he paused a moment in the doorway. “Chase up to the little girls’
Room and wash your face. I’ll be waiting for you right here. For the love of Pete, hide that damn handkerchief until you get a chance to burn it.”

“Yes, Jake.” Her voice seemed almost too docile.

Jake decided to stop worrying. Luckily, Max’s was the best place for her to be seen tonight. It was a comfortable, informal, noisy restaurant and bar, where the cast of the Nelle Brown Revue usually gathered after the show. Everyone would remember that Nelle Brown had been there; everyone would remember that she had been her usual lighthearted self. (He hoped!)

Oscar Jepps paused on his way to the bar. “Where the hell have you two been all this time?”

“Riding around Grant Park in a taxi,” Jake said.

Oscar laughed appreciatively, shaking a collection of chins. “That’s very funny.”

There was nothing, Jake reflected, like telling the truth if you wanted to get a reputation as a wit.

Then Nelle returned, no sign of tears on her serene face. The pale-green handkerchief was stuck outrageously through her bracelet, innocent of any stain.

“Washed it,” she whispered impishly.

They were greeted by an uproar of welcome from one end of the big room. There was much confusion of rearranging tables, shifting chairs, and ordering drinks, but when everyone had settled down again, Jake was right at Nelle’s side, where he had intended to be.

He sipped his rye slowly and looked around the room. You couldn’t, he reflected, heave a brick in any direction without hitting a radio artist. (And why not?) There was Bob Bruce, big and blond and handsome (his good-looking face was the trial of his life). McIvers, looking as though he never got enough sleep (he never did); Lou Silver, a little, shiny-haired man, showing off before a heavily mascaraed brunette; a stranger with glasses and a red mustache (they never did find out who he was); the pale, fastidious, Boston-accented John St. John and his homely, brown-haired wife who could be such amazingly good fun (Jake remembered the weekend of Oscar’s house party and had the grace to blush); a rather nice-looking blonde in a tight blue dress, and, on the other side of Nelle, the inevitable Baby.

There was, to Jake, a curious unreality about it all. There was the usual talk, the usual patter, the usual drinking, the usual attempts to put Essie St. John under the table. While only six or eight blocks away there was that crumpled body on a kitchen floor. He remembered how many times the man who lay dead had been with them at Max’s, with everyone trying to be nice to him for Nelle’s sake. Last year’s Baby, Jake thought grimly.

He looked slowly around the table. Had one of them slipped over to that shabby apartment between broadcasts and killed a man? But which one of them, and why? Or had it been Nelle after all?
