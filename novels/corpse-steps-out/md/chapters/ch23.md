### Chapter 23
## Devils and Dames

There was the body of Paul March on the floor, and there was the fire crackling and spreading. The thing to do, Jake agreed later, was to go away, drive away as fast as Helene’s car would go, let the fire destroy the evidence of some unknown person’s crime. That was what he thought later. But at the moment, the thing on the warehouse floor was the body of a man, and the fire was coming closer. Hardly conscious of what he was doing, he lifted it from the floor. It was cold and terribly hard, like ice. For the first time, he was aware of the almost obscene coldness of the refrigerating chamber.

“Jake, what are you going to do?”

“Get this out of here. Race out to the car, drive it into the alley—quick, Helene.”

She disappeared into the cavernous darkness like a frightened hare. He lifted the body over his shoulder, staggering under its weight. The smoke filled the warehouse now; choking and gasping, he made his way to a window on the alley side. As he reached it, he saw Helene’s long, sleek car turn into the alley, drive up, and stop.

He leaned the body against the wall while he struggled with the window and finally flung it open. One cautious look into the darkness of the alley, then he lifted the body through the opening and climbed after it.

It was then that he began to wonder what he was doing.

In the distance, he could hear the sound of a siren. Someone else had seen the warehouse fire.

There was no time to spend considering alternatives. Helene opened the door to the back of the car; Jake stowed the body of Paul March on the floor and carefully covered it with the rug. Then he climbed in beside Helene, slammed the door, and the big car backed down the alley. The wailing sirens were very close now.

“We should have gone straight ahead and turned down the other street,” Helene said grimly. “But it’s too late.”

They reached the corner in time to find it blocked by fire apparatus. A fireman swore at them irritably for being in the way. Finally, with no little maneuvering, they were free again. Beyond the corner, Helene stopped, close to the curb.

“Helene, for the love of heaven, get out of here.”

She switched off the engine. “No. That fireman noticed the car. If we drive away, he may get suspicious. If we park here and pretend we’re watching the fire, he’ll forget about it.”

In a more sober moment, he might have found a few flaws in her reasoning, but he could think of none at the time. He followed her down the street to where a little crowd had already gathered. The old building was blazing merrily now; great tongues of flames shot up into the night sky; dense clouds of smoke veiled the buildings nearby. Now and then, firemen appeared briefly on the roof and vanished again.

“Oh boy!” said a young man next to Jake. “She’s a dandy!”

To the indescribable delight of the crowd, the water tower came into position and shot foaming.
Ribbons into the upper windows. There was a moment of almost unbearable excitement when a fireman, overcome by smoke, was carried down a ladder from the roof. A woman in the crowd began screaming and was led away. Picture trucks arrived from the newspapers, and bursts of white light from the photographers' flashlights illuminated the burning building. A police squad car whined dismally around the corners.

Suddenly, the roof and part of a wall caved in with a resounding crash, sending clouds of dust and small debris to mingle with the smoke. Flames began to appear at every window, and policemen started moving the crowd farther away from the scene.

Without warning, there was a deafening roar, a flood of blinding light, a few moments of frantic activity. A moment later, a sheet of flame turned the street as bright as day. In that instant, a woman in the crowd screamed suddenly and clutched at a policeman.

"There she is!" she shrieked, pointing at Helene. "I saw her here when it started. She's a pyromaniac. I heard a man with her say—"

It was the black-haired waitress from Rickett's.

Helene turned and ran like a deer toward the car. Jake ran after her with a wild thought of stopping her and making explanations. But before he could catch up with her, she had leaped into the front seat and started the motor. He jumped in beside her and slammed the door shut just as the big car bounded forward. Looking back, he could see the policeman running hopelessly after them.

"Helene," he cried, "Helene, you can't do this—"

She paid no attention. The car raced down the dark street, swung north for a block, took a corner on two wheels, another block, and turned onto Michigan Avenue. In the distance, Jake could hear the siren of the squad car.

"Helene, stop—we can explain—"

She said grimly, "You forget we have a passenger."

It was very late, and Michigan Avenue was almost deserted. They sped through a stoplight, reached the approach to the bridge. Suddenly ahead of them, they heard bells clanging.

"You can't make it, the bridge is going up."

It was only the first warning bell, the barrier at the bridge was just beginning to move. She put on added speed, heading straight at the bridge. Someone near it ran into the street, waving at her frantically. The wailing siren was coming nearer now.

In one last burst of speed, she crossed the bridge, missing the last barrier by a hair's breadth. Jake could see it settle into place as she sped on down the avenue.

"Just like the movies," she gasped, "they on one side of the bridge and we on the other."

"Helene, you can't possibly get away—"

"Shut up," she said, "I'm trying to think."

She turned onto a side street, turned again and drove up an alley, made another turn, and entered the labyrinth of underground passages known as the lower level. Skillfully she maneuvered the big car into the cavernous street that was directly below Michigan Avenue and drove straight to the double-decked bridge. It was still up, and she paused at the barrier.

"When the bridge goes down, they'll be crossing south on the top of it," she said, "and we'll be crossing north on the bottom. Not bad, eh? A neat trick."

"A neat trick," Jake repeated angrily, "and then what? By this time a description of you and of this car is going out over the police radio into every squad car in the city."

"I'd leave the car somewhere," she said thoughtfully, "but they'd find it and find the passenger."

A boat whistled mournfully passing the bridge and went on down the Chicago River. The bridge began to go down, slowly, importantly, majestically; finally, it settled into place with a little shiver. The bell clanged for another moment while the barrier lifted.

As they drove across, they could hear the police siren wailing above them.

"What are you going to do?"

"Keep driving on streets the squad cars haven't even heard about," she told him.

She turned into a dark, deserted passage just beyond the bridge.
Edge, drove west a few blocks, turned north again. There was not another car in sight; the street was lined with unlighted factory buildings.

“Jake, I've got to have a drink.”

In the semidarkness he could see how pale she was. He remembered the bottle of rye, uncapped it, and held it to her lips.

“Jake, who took him there, and why? And what are we going to do with him?”

“I don’t know. He’s our story and we’re stuck with him.”

“Who would have known about the refrigerating room?”

“I knew, and Nelle, of course, and Tootz, and everybody connected with the show. You see, last year, just about this time, we gave a party for the cast. It was hotter than the hinges of hell, and somebody thought of what a bright idea it would be to throw the party in the old abandoned warehouse, with the refrigerating device going. It worked swell.”

“But why take him there?”

“Can you think, offhand, of a better place?”

She thought for a moment. “Outside of a park bench, no.”

Again he held the bottle to her lips.

“He’s an ingenious devil,” she remarked at last.

“Who?” Jake asked a little stupidly.

“St. John, of course. Who else?”

It was his turn to be silent.

“There can’t be any doubt but what St. John shot him,” she said after a while. “You said so yourself. And the person who shot him must have been the person who moved the body. The question in my mind is, why did he bother to move it?”

“He didn’t want the body to be found,” Jake said slowly, “because then his possession of the letters would automatically point to him as March’s murderer. He was counting on the fact that everybody would believe March had left Chicago, and nobody would know about the murder.”

“Then why not just dispose of the body so that it wouldn’t be found?”

“Ever try disposing of a body so it won’t be found?” Jake asked. “It isn’t as easy as it sounds. Besides, he might have had a reason for wanting the body where he could produce it.”

“Why, Jake?”

“So that if anything happened to the letters that were his hold over Nelle, he could use Paul March’s murder for the same purpose.”

She shivered.

“It was a perfect place to hide the body,” Jake said thoughtfully. “And naturally St. John would know about it, having been at the party. It would be easy as pie to break into the building, and not a Chinaman’s chance that anybody would blunder in and discover it. We never would have, if the place hadn’t caught on fire.”

She said very slowly, “By this time Essie has swiped the letters. Essie is away from home, and she told you the maid was away for the night. St. John is still deep in a drugged sleep.”

“Helene, just what do you propose doing?”

The big car leaped forward in a sudden burst of speed.

“We’re going to take the body up to St. John’s house and leave it with him,” she said happily. “It’ll just be our own little present to him, yours and mine!”
