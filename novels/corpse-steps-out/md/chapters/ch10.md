### Chapter 10
## The Corpse's Second Act

It’s one of the nicest apartments in the building,” Molly was saying. “Of course, I’ll have the curtains washed.”

Jake sank down in a worn overstuffed chair and stared dazedly around him. It was a large, square room, with two immense windows that opened onto a fire escape and looked into the back windows of apartments across the alley. There was a slightly battered but still handsome marble fireplace, now stuffed with old newspapers, a tapestry-covered davenport, a day bed in one corner, and a spinet desk in the other. Nowhere was there any sign of the previous occupancy of Paul March. Not so much as an abandoned magazine.

“Didn’t Paul March live here once?” Jake asked very casually.

Molly nodded. “Nice young man, too, but a terrible woman chaser. He left rather suddenly.”

“Oh, did he?” Jake murmured.

“Didn’t even say goodbye to me,” the landlady went on. “He was away all night, night before last, and in the morning he came and packed a handbag and left without seeing a soul. Sent me a nice note, though, with the back rent and an extra five dollars, asking me to pack his things and send them to him in care of American Express, Honolulu.”

“Well well,” Jake said in his most noncommittal voice.

“How do you like it?” Molly asked Helene anxiously, in a tone that suggested renting this apartment to her was the one thing that really mattered in the world.

“It’ll do beautifully,” Helene said, “I’m crazy about it. I’m moving in right now.”

She and Molly settled formalities of rent and receipt. Molly promised clean curtains the very next day, so help her, and left them.

“You don’t have to stay here, you know,” Jake said, after she had gone.

Helene paid no attention to him. “Jake, Honolulu is a long way from here.”

“A very long way,” Jake agreed. “By the time the American Express Company gets tired of trying to find Paul March there, and sends all his belongings back, nobody will give a damn about Paul March anymore.”

“Somebody,” she observed thoughtfully, “is being awfully modest about this murder. Help me unpack.”

They unpacked a collection of clothes that would have done credit to a Hollywood queen.
"Set a bottle of rye on the kitchen shelf," and stowed away the empty suitcase.

"Tomorrow," Helene said, looking around the room, "I buy vases and stuff at the dime store, and this will be elegant."

She vanished into the dressing room, reappeared in a pair of lounging pajamas the color of the center of a very pale rose, and opened the bottle of rye.

"I love our little home, dear," Jake said, settling down on the davenport. "Where shall we hang up the goldfish?"

She poured two drinks, set them on a table by the davenport, and sat down beside him.

"What a wonderful way that was to stave off any inquiries about Paul March's disappearance," she said.

"Wonderful, and simple. Anyone who wants to know where Paul March is, if anyone does want to know, will just be told that he's gone to Honolulu."

She sighed. "Jake, where would you hide a corpse, if you had to hide a corpse?"

"It's a problem I've never been faced with, but I'll think about it. Helene, why did you run away from me?"

"Because I was in love with you," she said calmly. "But if you had to hide a corpse, where would you hide it?"

"In the Cook County Morgue," Jake said, "because that's the last place anyone would think of looking for it. Did you really mean that?"

"Of course I mean it. It would be a waste of time though, I think."

"What? Loving me?"

"No. Looking in the Cook County Morgue for Paul March's corpse."

"Damn you," he said, "if you don't stick to one subject I'll get another girl. Do you still love me?"

"Of course I do. It must be hidden somewhere. You can't just make a body disappear into the air."

"Listen," Jake said. "Get the body of Paul March out of your mind for a few minutes, and me into it. Murders are happening every day in the year including holidays, but this may never happen to us again."

"Jake, let's get married."

He dropped the glass of rye he had been holding, it overturned on the carpet.

"Do you mean that?"

"Of course I mean it. But if you're going to go throwing good liquor around that way, I'll change my mind."

She found a rag in the kitchen, mopped up the carpet, and poured Jake another drink. "Keep your hands off that until you're sure you won't drop it."

"But Helene," he said stupidly, "we can't."

"Unless you have a wife and five children in Dubuque, we can," she said firmly. "We can and will."

"But you're rich," he said, still more stupidly.

"Good God," she said, "does that make me an old maid for life?"

"It wouldn't be right." He couldn't say it convincingly.

"Jake Justus, are you turning me down?"

"Damn it, Helene, I could never fit into your life."

"I seem to get along all right in yours," she said reflectively. "Jake, are you in love with me?"

He was silent a moment. "Yes, I guess I am. Yes, that's it."

"Well then, if I'm in love with you, and you're in love with me, we'll get married. That's all there is to it."

It did seem like a simple and perfectly plausible idea.

"Well," he said after a while.

"You're weakening," she observed. "Jake, when shall we be married, and where?"

He said very thoughtfully, "We could drive to Crown Point tonight, if we left now."

"Wonderful," she said. "Now you can drink your rye."

The rye helped a little, but he still felt dazed.

"But Helene," he said, in a final struggle. "Helene, your money."

She sighed. "Well, if you're going to be fussy, I can always give it away. I can think of any number of people who could use it. But it would be more fun to keep it. You'd be surprised how much fun we can have with money."

"I have a rough idea," he said, "but—"

"That's all it's good for, to have fun with. You've got to go right on being a press agent because I'll leave you if you ever give it up. I like your being a press agent. I meet so many people that way."

"Well, of course," he began slowly.

"Oh Jake," she said suddenly, "don't make it awful for me to have money. Like being born with a harelip or something. I can't help it.
It’s just been a damn nuisance all my life, and if it spoils things, I can’t stand it. Let’s be sensible.”

“All right,” he said, “we’ll be sensible. But I’m going to tell everybody that I'm marrying you for your money. Nobody could ever be able to imagine any other reason.”

“If we’re going to Crown Point,” she said reflectively, "I'd better get dressed, unless you don’t mind my being married in pink pajamas.”

“It would save time,” he told her, “but it does seem a bit expedient.”

She looked into his eyes for a long moment. “I can’t believe it. I'm really here and you’re really here, and we’ll never be separated again. It’s been so long, Jake.”

“The longest year and a half on record.”

“I ought to have a new dress,” she said after a pause. “But never mind that. I have you, and one can’t have everything. After all, Jake, if we’re going to be married today, you might kiss me—"

He did, and thought what a very long time a year and a half had been.

“Jake,” she said suddenly, and then, “Jake, how do you suppose the body was gotten out of here without—"

Just then there was a thundering knock at the door. Helene opened the door; it was Molly. “Telephone for Mr. Justus. And Miss Brand, there’s a buzzer over your door. Three rings means you’re wanted on the telephone.”

The telephone was on the first floor. Jake raced down, two steps at a time. It could only be Nelle, or John Joseph Malone. And either one probably meant trouble.

It was Nelle. Her voice was tight and frantic.

“Jake, have you had dinner yet?”

“No, but—"

“Jake, I've got to see you. Meet me at Ricardo’s in half an hour. Bring that blonde with you if you can, she’s got brains. And Malone, if you can find him.”

“But Nelle—"

“I've found out who it was,” she said. “The letters. My letters. I know who has them.”

Before he could answer, she had hung up.
