### Chapter 11

“Never mind,” Helene said consolingly. “We can get married tomorrow. And it’ll be so nice to find out who the murderer was.”

She had dressed in something pale and cool while he was at the telephone. They picked up Malone at his hotel, selected a table in a far corner of Ricardo’s, and waited for Nelle.

“I bet Nelle feels relieved at knowing who it is,” Jake said, with little conviction.

Malone looked toward the door. “She doesn’t look it.”

Nelle was coming toward the table, her face stormy.

“The dirty rat,” she said as she sat down. “The double-dirty stinking double-crossing bastard ape. I might have known it. Nobody else in the world would think of a lousy trick like that. I always thought he looked like a murderer anyway. And if he thinks for one split second that he can get away with it—"

“Take a drink,” Jake said mildly, “and catch your breath.”

She took the drink and caught her breath. “I'm not going to do it, that’s all. I’m damned and double-damned if I’m going to do it.”

“Menu?” said the gentle Italian waiter apologetically.

“Go to hell,” she said absent-mindedly.

“You’re double-damned if you’re going to do what?” Helene asked.

“I might have known all along he’d be the one who had the letters,” Nelle said.

“All right,” Jake said, “that’s a fine dramatic buildup. Who?”

She stared at him. “John St. John, of course.”

The waiter took advantage of the momentary silence to come back with the menu.

“Later,” Jake said, waving him away, “and bring us a drink.”

“And then,” Nelle added, “to try to tie me up with a contract like that!”

“Reorganize yourself,” Jake said, “and start this over.”

“He telephoned and said he had to talk with me and it was urgent. Then he came up to the apartment. Tootz was taking a nap. He said he had the letters.”

“He admitted it!” Jake said. “But good God, that’s practically an admission of guilt!”

“What of it?” Malone asked. “You’re hardly in a position to call a cop.”

“He didn’t say how he got them except that it was none of my business,” Nelle said. “Then he said he didn’t want to make any trouble.”
For me. Trouble! The low-down—"

“You can leave your personal impressions of him out of this,” Jake said.

She ignored him. “He’s nasty,” she said, “he’s mean. He gives me the creeps. He’s got a fancy accent, and he was born in Nebraska. And he’s cold-blooded as a fish.”

“How do you know?” Jake asked interestedly.

“Pure hearsay,” she said indignantly.

“Well, how was I to tell?” Jake said mildly. “After all, there was a time when you hadn’t sold the program.”

Helene said hastily, “But how did he know about the letters and that Paul March was blackmailing you?”

“We’ll get to that later,” Jake said. “Right now, I want to know what St. John has up his sleeve besides his handkerchief. Go on, Nelle. What’s the rest of it?”

“A contract like that,” she said indignantly. “It’s a conspiracy, that’s what it is. And if he thinks he can sell the show to Givvus—you know, Jake, the soap man— he’s squirrelly. Givvus and Company!” She produced a lengthy and impolite sound.

“That’s very effective,” Jake said, “but your narrative is terrible. Try it all over again, possibly from the beginning.”

She drew a long breath, took a drink, and lit a cigarette. Jake had the impression that she was mentally counting ten, slowly.

“Start with the contract,” he added.

“It’s a personal-management contract St. John is having drawn up for me to sign. You know the sort of thing, Jake. Absolute management of all work, all my contracts signed through him, he collects all income and pays me a weekly salary.”

“Good God,” Jake said.

Nelle said, “That’s what I thought.”

“But then,” Helene said, in a slightly dazed voice, “he could collect all your dough, and pay you fifty dollars a week if he wanted to.”

“Hell,” Jake said, “he could pay her ten dollars a week. Such things have happened before, but usually because some promising dope signed up with a grafter before knowing any better.”

“It’s blackmail,” Nelle said furiously, “that’s what it is.”

“And what’s this about Givvus and Sons?” Jake asked.

“He’s wanted to sell the show to them for a long time,” Nelle said. “Givvus is his pet personal account, and with the show sold the way it is, he—St. John— doesn’t make any money out of it. If he personally sells the show to Givvus, he’ll make a hell of a lot in commissions.”

“Well, as far as that part of it is concerned,” Malone said, “What the hell do you care?”

“Goldman is such a swell guy,” she said, “and things are practically ideal the way they are. He lets us run the show, and we let him run his candy business, and there’s never any trouble. With St. John running things for the Givvuses, we’d all go nuts. And besides,” she added, “it’s the principle of the thing.”

The waiter appeared with the tray of drinks and waved the menu at them hopefully.

“Go away,” Jake said. “Look here, Nelle, he can’t do it. Goldman has an option.”

She nodded. “But the option is up tomorrow night at six. Goldman and Joe Mclvers are such pals that they aren’t worried about re-signing the contract. Goldman wanted to do it with a big gesture at the broadcast next Friday and have his picture taken putting his pen to the dotted line. St. John knows that, and he knows that after six o’clock tomorrow night he can sign with Givvus.”

“Well,” Jake said slowly, “we can get hold of Goldman tomorrow and get the option taken up before expiration, and Givvus can go peddle his soap somewhere else.”

“I thought of that,” Nelle told him. “But in the first place, Goldman is somewhere up on the Brule River catching fish and Joe is with him, and he isn’t coming back until day after tomorrow. And in the second place, the letters.”

“What do you mean?” Malone asked.

“The letters St. John has. I don’t know how he got them from Paul March, but anyway, he has them and that’s enough. He said if I tried to communicate with Goldman or Joe, or didn’t do just as he ordered, he’d send half the letters to Tootz and the other half to Papa Goldman himself."
“I can see Papa Goldman,” Jake said, musing. “If he once had the faintest idea that you’d ever committed anything worse than dropping a lead nickel in a phone box. Not a pretty picture. Nelle, St. John seems to have you very nicely.”

“Give me a little time to think,” Malone said. “What does he want you to do?”

“He’s planned a secret—very secret—audition for Givvus tomorrow,” she said. “Givvus is flying from the East for it. Hardly anybody at the studio knows anything about it and nobody at the agency. Rehearsal at eleven and the audition in the afternoon.”

“If Givvus is all set to sign the show,” Jake said, “why the hell does he have to have an audition? Hasn’t he heard it on the air?”

“He wants to hear it the way it would be presented for his product, I suppose,” Nelle said. “That’s all I know. Ask St. John.”

Jake said, “I’m God damned if I'll ask St. John anything, even the time of day. Malone, what are we going to do?”

“I don’t know yet,” Malone said, “unless we could pin the Paul March murder on St. John in such a way that Nelle would be protected, and do it between now and tomorrow night when the option on your show expires.”

“Easy,” Jake snorted, “especially as we don’t know where the body is, and anyway maybe St. John had nothing to do with it.”

“He must have done it,” Nelle said, “he’s a murdering bastard if there ever was one.”

Malone said, “Let me think.”

“Go ahead and think,” Helene said, “we’ll watch.”

The waiter appeared out of nowhere. “Perhaps now,” he began.

“Look here,” Jake said sternly, “the minute we’re ready to order, we’ll send you a telegram.”

“You’re breaking his heart,” Helene said sympathetically.

“Listen,” Nelle said suddenly, “could we bluff him?”

“Possibly,” Jake told her, “but it’s my hunch he’d just keep on coming back with that menu until we gave in and ordered.”

Nelle’s retort was brief, appropriate, and highly colored.

“Couldn’t we tell St. John we’d found Paul’s body,” she said more calmly, “and that we knew he’d killed him, and that if he didn’t give back the letters and forget this audition, we’d tell the police?”

“Wonderful,” Jake said. “Can’t you see how the police would love it? What murder? Where’s the body? Who did it? Prove it. Where’s Paul March? Gone to Honolulu along with his luggage. And even if we could prove there had been a murder, St. John knows that to try to prove it would drag the whole story into the open, letters and all.”

“Well,” she said unhappily, “it was the best I could think of. How are you doing, Malone?”

“It seems to me,” Malone said, mopping his face, “the best thing for you to do is play along with him. Go ahead and put on the audition and somehow delay the signing of the contract just as long as you can.”

“What good will that do?” she asked.

“If Goldman signs the contract first anyway, St. John will be up a tree very nicely. With the contract signed with Goldman, St. John can’t turn up the letters without destroying a valuable property for his agency, which would put him in the soup. His one chance is to get his contract signed first, just as quick as the Goldman option expires.”

“That’s right,” Jake said.

“So,” Malone went on, “you play along with him tomorrow, and I’ll fly up to Brule tomorrow and try to locate Goldman and get his contract signed before St. John can make his move. Apparently you won’t have anything to do with the contacting of Goldman, and St. John’s stunt will just fall through.”

“And the letters?” Nelle said.

“I said, he won’t be able to use them without destroying a valuable property for his agency. There’s only one thing he’ll be able to use his letters and his damned personal-management contract for.” Malone described it briefly.

“Malone,” Helene said, “you’re superlative.”

He bowed. “All depending,” he said, “on whether I can find this guy tomorrow. I think I can. Anyway, by God, I’ll try.”

“And I hope,” Jake said sternly to Nelle, “this will be a lesson.”
"Nice to see you."

"It has been," she promised. "I'll never write another letter, even to a vox-pop column. Now where's that waiter? I'm hungry."

They looked around. The waiter was nowhere to be seen.

"Probably gone out to dinner," Helene said.

Malone looked at his watch. "Probably gone home to bed."

Nelle looked apologetic. "I hope you didn't have anything planned for this evening."

"Just to get married, that's all," Jake said crossly.

Malone laughed politely. "That's very funny."

Jake's fingers tightened around the neck of the ginger-ale bottle. "I've had enough. The next person, male or female, who says that to me, gets his face shoved down his neck. And when I say that, I'm not being funny!"
