### Chapter 16

Jake's mind raced as he sprinted down the hall. Who fired the gun? Was it Nelle? Could she be the murderer? Or had someone intruded while he was on the phone?

He burst into the room, followed by the disheveled brunette and others. Nelle sat smoking on the davenport, while Helene held a peculiar contraption.

"What happened?" the brunette gasped.

"The gun, where—" Jake began.

"I have it," Helene interrupted, triggering the contraption. A gunshot echoed in the room, causing the brunette to scream.

"Good Lord!" Jake exclaimed. "It's Krause's sound effect!"

Helene chuckled. "Apologies for the scare."

Only then did Jake notice the onlookers in the doorway.

"You certainly gave us a fright," a young man with a mustache remarked, wiping his brow. "You truly did!"

Helene appeared surprised.
Ed. “You mean you could hear this thing all the way down the hall to your room?”

“Hear it!” the young man said, “I thought the little men were landing from Mars!” He mopped his brow again. “I’m glad no one was shot. Come on down and have some beer.”

Helene brightened. “We’d love to,” she said. “But to make up for frightening you, let me bring along a drink. Besides, I just moved here, and I ought to buy the drinks.” She tucked the bottle under his arm, and they followed her through the door. Jake waved to Nelle to come along.

No one bothered with such trivialities as introductions.

“A whole quart!” the young man said admiringly. “You’re going to be a wonderful addition to the neighborhood!”

The young man’s room was small, and there were only two chairs and a bed to sit on, but no one minded. After the rye was gone, Jake went to the corner for two half-gallon bottles of beer, and then the young man with the mustache went to the corner for two more half gallons. Then someone else went to the corner for more rye. By that time, Jake had learned that the previous occupant of Helene’s apartment had been named Paul March, that he had been a very handsome young man who had something to do with the radio business, that he’d owed a little money to nearly everybody in the building, that he’d promised the disheveled brunette to get her a job on the radio, and that he’d once had a blondish girlfriend, described as pretty by the mustached young man.

Except for the beer, Jake had a feeling that the evening had been wasted.

At last, he rounded up Nelle and Helene, and they left after a slight argument with someone who wanted to know how Jake could get away with taking two women home from the party. The three of them went into Helene’s apartment and shut the door.

The sound effect still lay on the table. Helene picked it up and looked at it thoughtfully.

“Don’t do it,” Jake begged. “This time someone will call a cop.”

She sighed and put it down.

“Krause will have you arrested,” he observed. “He loves those things like a mother. What did you do it for?”

“I wanted to know if you could hear a revolver shot down in that room when a party was going on, and I found out. You could.”

“Yes,” he agreed, “you certainly could.”

“So why didn’t they all come down to find out what had happened the night Paul March was shot?”

“Oh,” Nelle said, “I see now!” She paused. “It’s a pity you can’t go and try that in the client’s room where Mr. Givvus was shot and see if it can be heard in the reception room—"

“Don’t suggest it,” Jake said with feeling. “You don’t know her. She’ll try it.”

Helene sniffed. “I don’t need to try it. I’m sure nobody heard the shot this afternoon, or it would have been investigated. Therefore, no one did.”

“Therefore,” Jake picked it up, “someone used a gun with a silencer in both cases, and that must mean the same person committed both murders. I’ll believe just so far in coincidence, and no farther. Helene, when are we going to get married?”

“Tomorrow,” she said promptly. “But Jake, it was St. John who shot Paul March. It must have been. And that means—”

“Can you imagine St. John shooting a prospective client during or before an audition?” Jake asked scornfully. He looked searchingly at Nelle. “Nelle, if by any chance you’re lying to me about this, I’ll break your neck, so help me God.”

“But I’m not lying to you,” she said desperately.

He sighed. “As a matter of manners, I’ll believe you. But you could have done both murders, and you had a motive for each of them. In the second one, you had a motive that worked both ways—I mean, whether you thought you were shooting St. John, or knew you were shooting Givvus, your contract would be all right.”

“Do you think I’d commit a murder for a contract?”

“Hell,” Jake said, “for a good contract, you’d do much worse than that.”

“Stop picking on her,” Helene said indignantly.

“Don’t mind me,” Jake said mildly, “I’m just tired.”
Just trying to solve a couple of murders.”

Helene frowned. “Find someone who had a motive for murdering both Paul March and either St. John or Mr. Givvus.”

“And then,” Jake said, “find who had the opportunity in both cases, and has a gun with a silencer on it, and then pin it on this unknown person in such a way that Nelle won’t be dragged into it, and then get her letters back safely.” Jake sighed. “Nelle, this woman hasn’t any more liquor. Let’s go home.”

Nelle rose to her feet a little uncertainly. “I’ve got to go home anyway. It’s late.”

“I'll drive you home,” Helene said. “You too, Jake.”

In the first-floor hall they ran into Molly, looking very forlorn and on the verge of tears.

“Thank God!” she exclaimed. “If I hadn’t found anyone to have a drink with me, I’d have gone right out the window.”

They paused long enough to help her finish a bottle of gin, and listened while she told them about her life, which had been unquestionably very sad. Then Helene performed a miraculous feat of driving that landed them in front of Nelle’s apartment building, and Jake saw her safely into the elevator.

“I’ll send the sound effect back tomorrow, anonymously,” Helene said on the way back, “if it’s on your conscience.”

“It’s not on my conscience,” Jake said, “but with a new baby and a wife in the hospital, Krause has enough trouble without losing his revolver-shot sound effect. Helene, you don’t want to go home. I don’t want to go home. It’s still early. Only two o’clock. We’re still sober. Let’s go somewhere and buy a drink.”

“We’ll do nothing of the kind,” she said firmly. “I'm taking you to your door, and you’re going right upstairs and go to bed and go to sleep. Then I’m putting the car away and going home myself. You may have forgotten it, but you’re going to be married tomorrow.”

Jake sighed deeply. “I’m afraid that matrimony is going to be a terribly sobering influence on you,” he said thoughtfully. “Maybe I won’t marry you after all.”

She drove in silence for half a block.

“All right,” she said, “all right. But we only stop for one drink. One!”
