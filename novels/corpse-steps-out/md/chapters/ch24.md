### Chapter 24
## Breaking Point

But you can’t do that,” Jake said in a dazed voice. “It’s wrong. It’s—it’s arson.” “You’ve got the wrong crime,” she told him. “That’s what they’re chasing me for.”

“Well damn it,” he said, “anyway it’s illegal.”

“So is driving around with a murder victim in the back of the car,” Helene observed.

He could find no answer to that one.

“Besides,” she said after a pause, “it’s dangerous. Driving around, I mean.”

“True,” Jake agreed. “But suppose St. John didn’t murder Paul March,” he said after a little serious thought.

“Have you the faintest shadow of a doubt about it?” Helene asked.

“Well,” Jake said reflectively, “well, no.”

She said, “You’d better take a drink.”

“That’s the first really good idea you’ve had,” Jake said.

“Where does St. John live?” she asked, a few blocks later.

He told her, adding, “But suppose someone catches us in the act of presenting St. John with a frozen stiff. A stiff, frozen stiff,” he muttered after a little pause.

“You didn’t think of that when you presented Lincoln Park with the late Mr. Givvus.”
She said irritably.

That was when Jake gave up the argument.

“I hope this fixes St. John’s wagon once and for all,” she said virtuously. “It’s not that I object to his going around murdering people, but I’m getting tired of driving the victims around.”

She drove north through an intricate maze of dark and deserted streets, miraculously escaped becoming hopelessly lost, and finally turned into the street where St. John lived. It was quiet and very peaceful. Half a dozen cars were parked in front of buildings here and there, but there were few lights, little motion.

“There’s the house, Helene.”

The big car slid noiselessly up the driveway and stopped beside the back porch. Jake stole softly up the steps and tried the door. It was unlocked.

“Where would be a good place to put it?” Helene whispered.

“Somewhere so that the maid will be the one to find him in the morning. It would be better if someone else rather than St. John discovered the body.”

“In the kitchen, then.”

Jake looked up and down the street, saw that no one was in sight. Carefully and very quietly, he carried the body of Paul March up the back steps, across the narrow porch, and into the kitchen. On a sudden inspiration, he propped it up beside the kitchen door so that it would fall across the floor the instant the door was opened. Then he closed the door silently and tiptoed back to the car.

“Drive away as quietly as you can.”

She backed the car very slowly and gingerly down the driveway, almost without a sound.

“Helene, stop a minute.”

She obeyed. He laid one hand on her shoulder and pointed toward a lighted window. Through it, they could see John St. John, huddled in an easy chair before his radio. In the still night, they could hear the faint sound of dance music coming from the loudspeaker.

“All right—drive on.”

She turned out of the driveway and into the dimly lighted street. Jake laughed a little bitterly.

“What amuses you?”

“I was thinking of St. John, imagining that he has Nelle’s letters in his pocket, Paul March’s body safely hidden away where it will never be found, and everything all serene. Picture him waking up tomorrow to find that the letters are gone, heaven knows how or where, and the maid coming in saying, ‘Excuse me for disturbing you, Mr. St. John, but there's a dead man in the kitchen.’”

“Your blackface accent is terrible,” she commented. “Picture Essie St. John finding out that St. John has gone to the jug, and she won’t have to live with him anymore. Picture Nelle finding out that the letters are out of the way. Jake, do you feel like a Boy Scout?”

“I feel like a troop of Boy Scouts.”

“I’m beginning to feel like a fugitive,” she said meditatively. “What are we going to do about all these policemen looking for me?”

He swore irritably. “I’d forgotten that for the moment.” He was silent, thinking fast. “The first thing is to get rid of the car. This fancy gas buggy of yours can be spotted a mile away.”

“So if you think I’m going to sink it in the lake, you’re crazy.”

“Don’t interrupt me. I know a garage where it’ll be safe. Know the garage man.” He gave her the address, near Lincoln Park.

“I hate to do this,” she said. “I feel like a lost child without the car.”

“You’ll get it back in a day or so. Malone can straighten this out for you. As I’ve said before, what have we got a lawyer for?”

She drove to the address Jake had given her, parked the car in an alley while he went in to make arrangements. A few minutes later, he returned, accompanied by a heavy-set man in overalls who nodded to Helene and slid into the driver’s seat. She rescued a package of hairpins and the remains of Jake’s bottle of rye from the side pocket and watched forlornly while the overalled man drove the car into the darkened garage.

“It’ll be safe there,” he consoled her. “He’ll never let anyone find it as long as the police are out looking for it.”

“How did you explain things to him?”

“I told him you…”
"I'd just assisted in the hijacking of a truck and the cops had gotten a description of the car.”

“Thoughtful of you.”

“Now we stop at a drugstore and phone Nelle.”

They stopped at the first corner. He called Nelle’s apartment; no one answered.

“Must be Bigges’ night off,” he commented. “But I can find Nelle.” He thought for a moment, called Baby, found that Nelle was there, and got her on the phone.

“I can’t say anything over the phone,” he told her, “but I wanted you to know all your troubles are over.”

“Jake, are you drunk?” she asked over the wire.

“That’s beside the point. Your property, if you know what I mean, has been safely recovered from a gentleman that it didn’t belong to.”

“Oh, darling!”

“Don’t call me darling,” he said righteously. “Helene can hear you. Furthermore, another object that was lost has been found, and a crime that was committed will be blamed on the individual who committed it.”

“You talk like a swami,” she complained.

He caroled happily into the phone. “Way down upon the Swami River,” and said hastily, “Don’t hang up, I just wanted to warn you to be surprised when you read the morning newspapers.”

“What are you going to do now?”

“I’m going to get married. Goodbye.” He hung up, called Malone’s hotel, was told that the little lawyer was not in his room nor in the lobby, though a bellhop remembered seeing him sitting in the lobby earlier in the evening.

He looked at his watch. It was nearly three hours past the time when he had promised to meet Malone. He joined Helene at the news counter, found her reading an account of the chase of a blond woman believed to be a pyromaniac. According to the paper, the woman’s car had last been seen on Michigan Avenue, going south, and was believed headed for Hammond, Indiana.

“Nice, fast work,” he said admiringly, “both by the papers and by ourselves, though heaven knows why everything gets blamed on Hammond.”

“Heaven knows why everything gets blamed on me,” she complained.

He looked at her. The pale gray dress was dusty and stained, a cobweb clung to the deep gray wrap. Her hair was pleasantly disheveled; there was a small smudge of dirt across her beautiful nose.

“Your face is dirty and you look like hell, but I still love you. Let’s get out of here and into a taxi.”

They found a taxi near Lincoln Park, gave the driver the Erie Street address. As they neared the building, a police car passed them, driving slowly. Jake tapped on the glass partition.

“Let us out in the alley. Her husband doesn’t know she’s out.”

The driver nodded sympathetically, turned up the alley, and let them out near the rear of the building.

“Jake, can you get me in safely?”

“I think so. There’s any number of ways of getting into this place.”

He helped her over a board fence, across a narrow backyard, and through a door that led into the basement. They went a little cautiously past a coal bin and through a furnace room to a narrow flight of wooden stairs.

“Better let me go first to smell out the way. The place might be crawling with cops.”

He tiptoed to the top of the stairs. No one was in the halls; the building was quiet and deserted. He motioned to Helene to follow him. There was a light showing faintly above Molly’s door, he rapped softly.

“Come in,” Molly called.

He led Helene into the room. Molly was sitting by the window, talking with a plump, brunette girl who was dressed lightly and simply in a bright-colored cotton kimono.

“This is Rose,” Molly said by way of introduction. “She couldn’t sleep and came down to talk to me. My God, what’s happened to you? Do you know the police are looking for you?”

“Know it!” Jake said bitterly.

Helene sank into a chair.

Jake told the story of his unfortunate remark in Rickett’s, explained that they had innocently gone to watch what looked like a good fire, and gave a few details of the subsequent chase. The plump brunette seemed to find it amusing.

“Thank God it’s n
"Nothing worse!" Molly said with feeling. "The cops have been all over this place. Someone told them she lived here. They looked at everybody in the building, and made a note of all the apartments where the occupant was out, and said they’d be back later. In fact," she said very calmly, looking out the window, "they are back."

Helene turned pale. "Oh God. All that chasing around for nothing!"

"Nothing, my eye!" Molly said indignantly. She rose very leisurely, and said, "Rose, you go up in 215 and get into this young lady’s bed. Look as if you lived there. And you two—" she looked at them speculatively for the barest moment, and opened a door that led into a little linen closet. "Get in there and keep quiet."

The plump brunette ran through the door and down the hall with surprising speed and agility. Molly Coppins shoved Jake and Helene into the little linen closet, shut the door, locked it, and withdrew the key.

"Hope she doesn’t forget where she hides the key," Jake whispered. He put his arms around Helene and held her close, realized that she was shivering from head to foot, and patted her comfortingly.

They could hear a thunderous knock at the door.

"I’m coming," Molly called crossly.

There was the sound of an opening door, a brief babble of voices in the distance, voices that grew slowly fainter, and then silence for a very long time. They stood waiting in the stuffy darkness, clinging to each other, hardly daring to breathe.

Then there were the voices again, coming to a slow crescendo outside Molly’s door and fading once more into a silence disturbed a moment later by the faint wailing of a police siren that was, in its turn, swallowed up by the quiet night. Molly unlocked and opened the door. They stood for a minute blinking at the light.

"It’s all over," Molly told them. "They wanted to look in 215 because it was empty when they were here before, and it looked like a woman lived there. It’s all right. They won’t look there again."

"Why not?" Jake asked, one arm around Helene.

The fat woman chuckled. "Rose peeled off her kimono and was in bed when they knocked. She didn’t answer the door and unlocked it for them. She sat bolt upright in bed, mother naked, and cursed us out for waking her. Boy, did she give those cops an earful!" She chuckled again. "I bet they’re blushing yet. They still think their blond firebug lives in the building, but they won’t look in 215 again. You’ll be safe there, Miss Brand."

Jake looked at Helene. She was very pale, swaying ever so little. He picked her up like a child.

"Help me get her to bed, Molly. She’s all in."

"And no wonder," Molly said sympathetically.

Jake carried her up the stairs; Molly helped her to undress and tucked her in bed. Jake washed the soot from her face and hands, and patted the covers up under her chin. She lay there like an exhausted child.

"Poor little thing," Molly said, adding, "too bad she’s so tired, Jake. This would be a wonderful time to get up a party."

Jake looked up at the windows, saw just a faint gray light coming through. He reached down and patted Helene’s cheek, she opened her eyes for a moment and smiled at him.

"You may have forgotten it," he told her, "but this was the night we were going to go to Crown Point and get married!"

"One of the nights," said Helene, and was asleep before Jake could answer.
