### Chapter 14
## Encore for the Dead

With a quick, instinctive motion, Jake kicked the door shut, and laid one hand over Nelle’s mouth before she could scream.

“But he’s dead!” St. John said in a curiously flat voice.

“That’s not original,” Jake said grimly, “but God knows it’s true.” He took his hand away from Nelle’s mouth.
Ruth stood and pushed her into a chair.

“But,” St. John said, “he was alive when I left him here before the audition.”

Jake nodded. “Obviously. Unless you shot him yourself.”

St. John looked at him wildly. “Why would I shoot him? He was my client! I was auditioning for him.”

“I don’t know,” Jake said. Suddenly he looked at the loudspeaker. “St. John, was the loudspeaker turned on when you left him?”

“No. I showed him how to turn it on, and told him when we’d be ready to go ahead.”

“Well, it’s turned off now. So either whoever shot him turned it off—heaven knows why—or else it was never turned on, which seems more likely to me. And in that case, the murder took place before the audition.”

“You mean,” Nelle said, and stopped. “You mean we went through all that awful rehearsal and everything, and the audition, and then nobody even heard it? You mean the loudspeaker was turned on and the audition came in here, and he was dead all the time?”

“I do,” Jake said, “and shut up.” He paused for thought.

“If he was shot before the audition, that means practically anybody might have done it. We were all milling around before the audition.” He looked closely at Nelle. There was no sign of emotion on her white face.

“But who would?” St. John demanded. “No one here even knew him.”

“It was a mistake,” Nelle said. “It must have been a mistake.”

“Why?” Jake asked.

“Or whoever shot him isn’t in the radio business,” she said.

“Nelle, what are you talking about?”

“Jake, no one in radio would shoot a prospective sponsor. He must have been mistaken for someone else.”

Jake looked closely at the late Mr. Givvus. He had been a small, spare man, with thinning gray hair, and tight, ungenerous lips.

“Look here,” Jake said, “we can’t stand around here wondering who shot him. We’ve got to do something.”

“Do what?” St. John said in a dazed voice.

“We’ve got to get him out of here. Think of the hell that would pop if he were found here in the client’s room. Everything connected with this unholy mess would come out, including your own shady part in it, St. John. Radio couldn’t stand the scandal, neither could you, and especially, neither could Nelle.” He was thinking fast. If Nelle had shot him—and who else would have wanted to—the body had to be gotten away as quickly as possible.

“But what can we do?” Nelle demanded wildly. “Thank God there’s no blood on the chair to clean up. He didn’t bleed much and it’s all on his coat. St. John, you’re in this party whether you like it or not. Get”—he thought for a moment—"get Schultz, Oscar, and Miss Brand. Bring them here. Make it quick, and keep your mouth shut.”

“What do you intend to do?” St. John asked, his hand on the door.

Jake said grimly, “I’m going to take Mr. Givvus for a ride.”

As the door swung shut, he turned to Nelle.

“Well, you don’t need to worry about whether Malone gets to Brule or not.”

“Oh Jake,” Nelle said, “the poor little guy. Who shot him?”

“I don’t know,” Jake said. “If you didn’t, maybe it was the same guy who shot Paul March, and maybe not. Or maybe Essie shot him thinking he was St. John.”

St. John returned. Schultz, Oscar, and Helene were with him. He had explained the situation on the way.

Jake locked the door. “St. John, how many people knew about this audition?”

“Outside of ourselves and the cast—the head of the sales department here. No one else.”

“Good. Somehow, we’ve got to get this guy out of here.”

Schultz cleared his throat. “It can be done. There’s a back elevator.”

“How about the elevator operator?”

“Leave him to me,” Schultz said.

“St. John, how did Givyus get here? Car, taxi, what?”

“He told me he walked over from his hotel.”

“That helps. You run along and start spreading the information that your client didn’t show up for the audition. I'll meet you here later in the reception room. Helene, get your car around to the rear entrance near the back elevator—Schultz will tell you just where. And
Nelle, you and Oscar get out in the reception room and start the biggest, noisiest row you can manage. You ought to be able to draw a good crowd. The rest, Schultz, is up to you.”

They left to carry out instructions. A few minutes later Schultz returned, carrying one of the smocks worn by the studio musicians and a bottle of whisky. He poured some of the whisky on the smock, put the smock on Mr. Givvus, pulled a beret over his head so that it concealed the bullet hole. Mr. Givvus’ straw hat bothered him a moment; finally, he stuck it on his own head.

He peered into the corridor. From the reception room they could hear Nelle and Oscar Jepps calling each other names in stentorian tones.

“No one around. Let’s go.”

They held the dead man upright by draping his arms over their shoulders and carried him to the waiting freight elevator. The operator sniffed the whisky-laden air disapprovingly.

“Someday one of these horn-tooters is going to get the ax for showing up corned,” he observed. “You should have taken his smock off, Schultz.”

“No time,” Schultz said. “Had to get him out of there before somebody saw him. I’ll take the smock off down in the car.”

The operator grinned. “That sound man, Krause, is going nuts,” he said.

“It’s his first baby,” Schultz said.

“That ain’t it,” the elevator man said, “some ape stole his revolver-shot sound effect out of the studio. It’s his own invention, and he’s fit to be tied. He wants to call the police.”

“Why the hell would anybody steal a sound effect?” Jake asked.

The elevator man shook his head. “Search me. Probably a gag. Last stop, all out.”

They dragged Mr. Givvus to the alley entrance where Helene was waiting with the car. There Schultz took off the smock and beret and put Mr. Givvus’ straw hat over the bullet hole. They sat him up in the back seat, propped up with cushions.

“Good luck,” Schultz said, and waved at them.

“Where to?” Helene asked, driving down the alley.

Jake didn’t answer.

“Well,” she said after a few blocks, “only last night I asked you where you’d hide a corpse if you had to hide a corpse.”

“Shut up,” Jake said, “I’m trying to think.”

“And you said you’d never been faced with that problem, and you’d think about it. Well, I hope you’ve been thinking.”

“Drive toward Lincoln Park,” Jake said.

The sun had set, and twilight was slowly settling over the city. As they reached the park, the light was shadowy, dim, almost hazy. Jake directed her to a little-frequented drive and finally told her to stop near a clump of bushes.

There was a park bench on the other side of the bushes, facing the lake. Jake looked around, made certain that no one was in sight, carried the late Mr. Givvus to the park bench, and sat him upright. As a parting touch, he found a folded newspaper in the car and spread it in the late Mr. Givvus’ lap. Then he climbed back in the car.

“Drive on,” he said. “You see, when you have a corpse to dispose of, you simply—"

“This time you shut up. Where to?”

“Back to the studio,” he told her. “I’m going to try to bluff those letters out of St. John.”

The reception room was quiet, nearly empty when they arrived. A page boy sat at the desk, absorbed in a copy of Amazing Stories. Nelle and John St. John were sitting on one of the davenports in stony silence, as far apart as possible.

Jake smiled at them pleasantly. “Don’t ask me,” he said amiably. “You’ll read all about it in the newspapers. Now, St. John, let’s have the letters that belong to Nelle.”

“I think I’ll keep them,” St. John said coldly.

Jake had expected that. “You wouldn’t like to have me tell the police about your client being shot when and where he was, and about your being the last person to see him alive, would you?”

St. John’s lips curved in an unpleasant smile. “And you wouldn’t like to have me tell the police how you disposed of the body, would you? I believe it’s a criminal offense. And if you did go to the police, I would have to...
Turn the letters over to them as part of the evidence, and of course the newspapers—” he let it go at that.

“Well,” Jake said after a pause, “I thought there was no harm in trying.”

St. John said, “In view of what has happened, Miss Brown’s contract will probably be re-signed with Goldman as expected, so she has nothing to worry about. The letters are in a good, safe place. I think I’ll keep them, just in case.”

“A general agreement of silence seems to be the most sensible idea,” Jake said.

St. John nodded.

“Just the same,” Nelle said, crossly, “you might tell us how you got the letters in the first place.”

“I got them from Paul March,” St. John said.

“Obviously,” Jake said, nastily. “What we’d like to know is what you did with his body.”

“Body?” St. John repeated blankly. Then he gave a polite little laugh. “Oh yes. That’s very funny.”

Jake made one sudden and cataclysmic motion. A loud sound shattered the pleasant twilight quietude of the reception room.

“Oh boy!” said Nelle Brown exultantly. “Oh boy! Right on the button!”
