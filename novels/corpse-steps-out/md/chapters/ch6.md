### Chapter 6
## The Case of the Clean Floor

Take stopped in at the little bar on the corner and ordered a double rye. He needed it. Then he strolled over to Michigan Avenue and began walking north, hardly conscious of where he was going.

What the hell!

There was this way of looking at it. Now that the body of Paul March had disappeared, there wasn’t the same chance of Nelle being involved in a nasty murder case. The body might turn up again somewhere else, but this would give him a little time.

A fine thing, with Nelle’s contract up for renewal. If the body had been found, and if Nelle had been seen going to the building last night, and if she’d been fool enough to tell anyone that March was blackmailing her—! But, he thanked his stars, it hadn’t been found.

What the devil had happened to the body of Paul March?

Of course, it wouldn’t have been hard to smuggle a body out of that building. It wouldn’t be hard to smuggle an elephant out of there, especially with a party going on. But where was the body now? What had been the idea of taking it away? And when would it be found?

There was an amusing possibility that it never would be, and no one would ever know Paul March had been murdered. No one save three people: Nelle, the unknown murderer, and himself. Jake conceded to himself that this might be two people. Of course, the disappearance would make some stir. After all, Jake reflected, the man must have had some friends. It was a cinch he had had some creditors. Anyway, there was the landlady to make inquiries. But a disappearance was hardly the same as murder.

Suppose no one ever knew!

All right, Jake thought, suppose no one ever did. It was no skin off his nose. Murder, as such, didn’t worry him. This wasn’t his murder, and he didn’t want to make it his. But Nelle was a valuable property, far too valuable to be destroyed. This might be profitable publicity in some other branch of the entertainment world. But not in radio. Oh no, Jake thought, not in radio! One good strong breath of scandal and Nelle’s value would drop to zero overnight. He’d seen it happen to too many others.

He speculated calmly on the possibility of Nelle as the murderer. If she had been, though, who had moved the body? Not Nelle, he’d been with her every minute since the rebroadcast.

His mind moved on to the next problem. Where were Nelle’s letters? This was a far more serious menace than an obligingly disappearing corpse.

He decided that it was something he couldn’t cope with himself, and a n
Name popped into his mind. John Joseph Malone.

Merely thinking of the name made him feel that the whole problem was a simple one, already half solved. John Joseph Malone, untidy, resourceful little criminal lawyer, who boasted that he could get anybody out of any mess. He could certainly get Nelle Brown out of this one.

Jake remembered how John Joseph Malone, whom he had known from his first days as a reporter, had turned up the real murderer of Miss Alexandria Inglehart of Maple Park and exonerated the murdered woman’s niece, Dick Dayton’s bride (Eight Faces at Three). That had been a tough one, even for Malone. (Though the lawyer still insisted that if Holly Inglehart Dayton had been brought to trial, he could have won an acquittal on the first ballot with an insanity defense.)

The thought of Malone brought another name to mind, and the shadow of a frown crossed his lean face.

Helene Brand! Was there another woman in the world like Helene Brand? She had wandered into the Inglehart case, a childhood friend of Holly, and had gone through it to the cockeyed end.

For a very long time now, he had tried not to think of Helene Brand. All during the Inglehart case he had tried to find time to carry out some very important and quite dishonorable intentions he had regarding her. Then when the case was closed, he had suddenly realized he wanted to marry her.

Insane and impossible idea! Helene Brand of Maple Park, famous beauty, socialite, heiress. Jake Justus of downtown Chicago, ex-reporter, manager, promoter, press agent, who would never amount to a damn. Yet, realizing her importance to him, he knew that he could not make casual love to her. That had been what she seemed to expect and—thoroughly disgusted with him, no doubt—she had vanished. Oh, it was probably just as well. He could see now that he hadn’t meant anything to her. Just an escapade, a mad moment in the life of an heiress. Nuts!

It had been nearly a year and a half ago. He remembered telling Nelle, in the worst stages of her heartbreak over Paul March, that time took care of everything in its own way. Well, time hadn’t seemed to make much impression on his memories of Helene Brand.

Why the devil couldn’t he forget her, anyway? He would never see her again.

But he knew it was the image of Helene Brand that kept him from making love to Nelle Brown, as Lou Silver, and Schultz, and Oscar, and nearly everyone connected with the program had done or tried to do. The delicately sculptured face of Helene Brand would always superimpose itself on any face he tried to kiss. The silvery, mocking laughter of Helene Brand would always drown out any lovely voice that called to him.

He reminded himself that he was not going to think of Helene Brand, and with a wrenching effort brought his mind back to today, to now, to Nelle Brown, the Nelle Brown Revue, and the murder of Paul March.

John Joseph Malone would handle it. Malone would find a way.

Jake passed Chicago Avenue, passed a group of chattering bathers bound for Oak Street beach, noticed Chicago’s Best-Dressed Woman crossing Michigan Avenue, and paused for a moment by the old water tower, gazing at the Palmolive Building as it stood, sharp and clear, against a blazing blue sky. He had seen it a thousand times before—veiled by snow, brilliant in the sunlight, or blurred by summer rain—but this time he paused to gaze and admire, letting the combination of gray stone and intense blue sky drive the worries of the moment from his tired mind.

In that moment a wonderfully familiar voice spoke just behind him.

“It looks just the way it does on the postcards!”

He wheeled around, knowing he couldn’t mistake that mocking drawl, not daring to believe it. It was true. Helene Brand!

There she stood, as patrician, as beautiful, as perfect as ever, in the midst of the noontime crowds on Michigan Avenue. Her pale blond hair was exquisitely in place, and she was dressed simply.
Ply in a very low-cut pale-violet chiffon evening gown. She was carrying a Parma violet evening wrap. And she was not sober.

“Well!” said Jake Justus inadequately. “Well! Imagine meeting you here!”
