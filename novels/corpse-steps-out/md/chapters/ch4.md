### Chapter 4
## Nelle's Notorious Night

How did you get to be a radio star?” the red-haired stranger was asking Nelle.

One of the penalties of being a radio star, Jake reflected, was that everyone asked you how you got to be that way.

Nelle simpered ever so slightly and said, “Well, I used to sing in the choir in the little Nebraska town where I was brought up, and one day—"

“Hell’s bells,” Oscar growled, “couldn’t Jake write you a better story than that?”

“He has,” John St. John said dispassionately, “several, in fact. Why don’t you write the true one someday?”

Jake grinned and said, “I might,” and wondered what would happen if he ever did. Nelle had been the daughter of a cheap entertainer in a fifth-rate dive. A few years in public school and a ratty home in a one-room basement apartment from which she was chased to the neighborhood movie whenever her mother had “company” constituted her childhood and education.

“How did you get into show business?” the red-haired stranger persisted.

Nelle looked him straight in the eye and told him she had been born backstage and had played little Eva at the age of six. The red-haired stranger looked interested but skeptical, and Ja
Ke remembered that Nelle had been adopted by the boss of a traveling medicine show at the age of twelve. He had seen pictures of her: a thin, rather attractive, leggy child, with a mass of curly hair, and immense, hungry eyes. Two years later, professing to be sixteen, she had turned up in the chorus of a second-rate burlesque company.

Along way from that to the Nelle Brown Revue. Jake sighed deeply, ordered another rye, and reflected that if this murder story broke the wrong way, Nelle would zigzag right back to a second-rate burlesque company.

“Let’s not talk about me,” Nelle was telling the red-haired stranger, her eyes wide and dewy. “Let’s talk about you.”

The tableful of Nelle’s friends cheered raucously, and the stranger lapsed into a discouraged silence.

“The truth is,” Oscar Jepps said, “when Nelle was seventeen she got to be a movie extra, and that’s how the whole thing started.”

He neglected to add that when Nelle was seventeen her life included some five years in more-or-less dubious show business and a marriage that had ended abruptly when her husband shot it out with the police of Kansas City. But the curious stranger appeared to be satisfied.

John St. John chose that particular moment to ask, “Did you ever find your script, Nelle?”

Nelle gave several minutes to discussing the undiluted whatsisname who could have stolen her script out of the studio before the broadcast, making it necessary for her to mark up another one at the last minute. She implied that whoever would have done such a thing had a maternal parent who was African, illiterate, unwashed, and unwed.

The red-haired stranger looked a little startled.

John St. John lifted his left eyebrow a trifle and muttered something about the inexcusable carelessness of leaving a script in the studio. Jake repressed an impulse to ask him whether his pale hair had been parted by an architectural draftsman or a certified public accountant.

Someone sent for another round of drinks.

The mascaraed brunette leaned across the table and asked, “Miss Brown, didn’t you used to sing with Dick Dayton’s band?”

Nelle nodded. “Almost a year. That’s where I met Jake; he was managing Dayton. Dayton was a big success and I was a big success, and so we split up.”

Mclvers broke his usual morose silence. “Eighteen months ago I had Nelle all ready to sign on the dotted line. Her own show, her own name headlined, and enough money every week to choke a horse. And then she went and got married.” He looked sadly into his glass.

Jake wondered why so many agency account executives appeared to have been marked by some great personal tragedy. The only real tragedy he knew of in Joe Mclvers’ life was that his pet sponsor, Papa Goldman, liked to fish, and Joe didn’t.

The red-haired stranger whispered to him confidentially, “Miss Brown is married?”

Jake nodded. “Henry Gibson Gifford.”

The stranger’s eyes grew appreciative. “Socialite millionaire. I know who he is.”

“Not a millionaire anymore,” Jake reminded him.

The stranger looked meditative. “Sixty, isn’t he?”

“Young in heart,” Jake said, wishing the man would go away.

“Talking about Tootz?” Oscar Jepps asked amiably, taking his plump hand off the arm of the blonde in blue.

Jake nodded and wished the red-haired stranger onto Oscar.

“Handsomest man of his age or any age in the city of Chicago,” he heard Oscar mumbling. “Best-dressed man in America. Most beautifully tended white hair and mustache in the civilized world.”

Jake recalled a bright-eyed and glowing Nelle confiding in him that Henry (though even then she called him Tootz) was so sweet, and she adored him. Of course, she was marrying him for his money. She’d be a fool not to, wouldn’t she? But he was such a lamb. She’d want to marry him if he didn’t have a dime in the world. Jake had told her at the time that she could think up the sweetest stories.

Oscar was explaining to the red-haired stranger
That Nelle would probably never have returned to radio if Gifford and Company hadn’t failed, leaving Tootz with nothing except the shirt on his back and a mortgage on that.

“But didn’t Henry Gibson Gifford lose his mind after the crash?” the red-mustached stranger asked in a whisper perfectly audible two blocks away. Three people managed to kick him under the table as he reached the last word.

“He has delusions,” Oscar murmured. The shadow of a grin crossed his cheerful, moonlike face.

Everyone began talking about the night’s broadcast.

Five drinks later, the red-haired stranger remembered something he had wanted to ask Nelle for a long time.

“How did you get to be a radio star?”

At that point Nelle was warmed up to answering, “I’ll tell you, if you’ll tell me how you got to be such a dope.”

The stranger was squelched again.

The party went on talking about the broadcast. Jake found he was pleasantly able to answer questions and remarks without annoying his mind about what he was saying. He heard St. John’s chilly voice address the young man next to Nelle as “Baby” and noticed the frown that crossed the young man’s face.

He felt a little sorry for Baby. What the hell was his real name, anyway? Oh yes, Macy McKee. No wonder Nelle called him Baby. A little different from the usual men in Nelle’s life. Young—a little too young for Nelle, he thought—a newcomer to Chicago from somewhere in the East. Not a bad actor, either. Oscar had praised his work, and no one was a better judge. Well, his affair with Nelle would give him a chance to show what talent he had. By the time it broke up, he ought to be established as an actor. Jake wondered if the boy knew that.

That reminded him of the current mess Nelle was in.

“Don’t forget to chase Baby home,” he whispered to her.

She nodded, and about three drinks later the young man was gone.

From Jake’s point of view, it was not a successful party. Perhaps, he told himself, because he was staying too sober. Or perhaps because he was trying to pick a likely murder suspect from the group around the table.

He managed a warning glance at Nelle, cleared his throat ever so little, and asked casually, “Anyone here seen Paul March lately?”

For an instant, it was as though mass paralysis had struck the party. (Though, he decided later, that might have been shock at his tactlessness in mentioning Paul March in front of Nelle.)

In the breath of time before several people murmured, “No,” and several others hastily changed the subject, he thought that Essie St. John, Oscar Jepps, Joe Mclvers, St. John and the red-mustached stranger all turned pale and looked guilty. He wondered if he’d turned pale and looked guilty himself.

The only positive decision he reached was that it was a damn silly idea to bother to stay sober, murder or no murder. He sighed, relaxed, ordered a double rye, and wished he was back press-agenting Dick Dayton and his dance band.

Oscar Jepps began insulting Mclvers. Oscar always had to insult someone to feel happy; he claimed it was the great producer in him coming to the surface. Everyone knew him as the gentlest and kindest-hearted man alive, and besides, no one as fat as Oscar Jepps could be really insulting. Mclvers took it gloomily, but nicely; everyone always insulted him just as a matter of course. It was like the Armenians, Jake thought, people were always massacring them because it seemed so suitable. There were some disconsolate individuals who were born to be abused; they either grew up to be Armenians or account executives in advertising agencies. Joe Mclvers always perspired and achieved a deeply apologetic air when insulted.

Jake remembered suddenly that Joe Mclvers hadn’t attended the rebroadcast. That was funny. He wondered where he had been.

John St. John wandered upstairs and lost twenty dollars in a crap game. Everyone was secretly delighted.

While he was gone, Essie St. John made a date with B.
Bob Bruce, and everyone pretended not to hear. The blonde in the tight blue dress asked Jake how she could get a job in radio, and gave him her telephone number, which he promptly lost. The red-mustached stranger upset his drink across the table.

It was exactly like every other evening at Max’s that Jake could remember. Except that one man who had spent so many evenings at Max’s lay dead behind the dingy green curtains of a little kitchenette.

The heavily mascaraed brunette slapped Lou Silver, probably with good reason, and left the table. Lou chased after her, and Oscar remarked that Lou Silver spent half his time chasing women.

“Ever catch any?” the stranger asked.

Oscar spotted Lou coming back alone, and said, “No.”

Lou played the out-of-tune piano and Nelle sang requests for everybody in the place. (A thousand or so a week for one program, Jake thought, and she’d sing all night for anyone who bought her a drink.)

Eventually, to his great relief, it was time to go home. There was the usual confusion over who was going where in whose car; in the midst of it he managed to get Nelle away without anyone noticing that they left together. Not that anyone would have cared. She muttered something about her fate being in his hands, curled up with her head on his lap, and went to sleep.

A sudden idea came to Jake, and he told the driver to go down Erie Street, slowly. Damned fool thing to do, he told himself. But he was curious. He wanted to see just what kind of a rumpus was going on at the scene of the murder.

There was no rumpus going on at all. No lights, no crowds on the sidewalk, no police cars in front of the long, low building. Nothing.

Was it possible the murder hadn’t been discovered?

Evidently it was not only possible, but true. Well, it would come any minute now. He knew that building from away back; people went wandering in and out of other people’s apartments all day and night. Sooner or later someone would wander into apartment 215.

A little later he deposited Nelle on the bed, covered her with a blanket, shaded the light from her face, and stood looking at her.

Nelle Brown. Her flaming rages when anything went wrong in rehearsal. Her spectacular language in anger, gleaned from years in burlesque companies, cheap nightclubs, and God knows where. The quick recovery she made from the very worst of her rages. The intensely dramatic quality of her singing and acting. The way she bullied poor Joe Mclvers at the agency. Escapades that all but turned Jake’s red hair white, keeping her out of trouble. Her insane love affairs, always ending disastrously. Her honest friendliness and generosity, always good for a touch. Her sweetness and gentleness with Tootz, always bringing a curious tightness into Jake’s throat.

Now, a mix-up in a murder case. She was, Jake reflected, just twenty-three years old! Lots more could still happen.

He poured himself a drink, turned his radio to the police calls, and sat listening.

“Car 117, go to 1219 Melvia Street, a disturbance in a tavern. W-P-B-D. Car 221, get a dog-bite report at 716 Marquise Avenue. Car 221, at 716 Marquise Avenue, a dog-bite report. W-P-B-D. Car 415, a suspicious man at the corner of—”

He poured himself another drink.

“W-P-B-D. Car 134, at the corner of State and Elm Streets, a policeman calling for assistance—"

“Officer, call a cop,” Jake said happily, and went on listening.

“—and Wabash. Car 152, at Eighth and Wabash, a man lying on the sidewalk. W-P-B-D. Car 123, a cat is caught in a drainpipe at—"

After an hour he switched off the radio, reflected that he would read all about it in the morning papers. There was nothing he could do about it tonight anyway. He turned off the light and went to sleep in his chair.
