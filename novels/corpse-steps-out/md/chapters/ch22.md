### Chapter 22
## A Tight Spot

Jake found Helene listening to a new installment of Molly Coppins’ life story. The evening was very warm, and she had changed into a dress that reminded him a little of a cloud, very faintly gray, almost misty. She greeted him enthusiastically.

“Five more minutes and I’d have married Malone. What have you been drinking?”

“Rye.”

“I’ve been drinking gin. We’d better think of a compromise. While we’re waiting for Malone, let’s go to Isbell’s for dinner.”

On the way, he told her what Essie had done and was going to do.

“Marvelous,” she said. “Now as long as nobody finds out how Mr. Givvus got moved to Lincoln Park, and Paul March’s body doesn’t turn up, everything is rosy.”

“Somehow I don’t anticipate Paul March’s body turning up,” he told her. “I’ve an idea St. John has hidden it pretty carefully.”

“St. John?”

“Who else? I don’t think St. John is a guy who would buy incriminating letters from some bird, and then take a chance on the bird coming back on him for more dough sometime.”

She sighed. “Wouldn’t it be nice if we could just pin it on him.”

“Wouldn’t it be nice if we could just forget the whole thing,” Jake said. He grinned wryly. “Funny thing. Nobody likes St. John except possibly St. John. Nothing would suit us better than to pin Paul Ma
Arch’s murder on him. We feel sure he’s guilty of it. And damn it, we can’t do a thing.”

“We can get married,” she said, “though that begins to seem just about as impossible. Jake, if St. John murdered Paul March, who murdered Mr. Givvus? Surely not St. John.”

“They’re different parts of two entirely different things.”

“You’re drunk. Jake, who murdered Mr. Givvus?”

“I’m not sure, but I think it’s part of a gang war.”

“You’re insane. Who murdered Mr. Givvus?”

“If you must know,” he said, “I did. And now shut up about it until after dinner.”

During dinner they argued the comparative merits of Erie Street and Jake’s hotel as a place to live. At last they left the restaurant and drove slowly toward the lake. A gentle quiet had settled with the darkness over Chicago’s near-North Side. A few strollers went up and down Michigan Avenue; on Superior Street people sat on their doorsteps, smoking and idly chatting. Half a dozen children who should have been in bed hours before played hopscotch under the street lamps. Out on the still lake, the lights of a few boats bobbed up and down. The world was very peaceful and very content.

Jake sighed happily and slid a little closer to Helene. “Is it the world that’s terrific or just the rye I’ve been drinking?”

She said softly, “I've never known which was the real and which was the dream. Jake, are things real when you’re drunk or when you’re sober? Are they real when you’re asleep or when you’re awake?”

“Quietness is real,” he told her. “Only that. The world was never as quiet as it is tonight.”

They drove in silence to Oak Street beach, went around the block, and started back along the Drive.

“In another hour it’ll be time to meet Malone,” Jake said. “He said he could get us married in Crown Point anytime up to midnight.”

“I’ll believe it when we get there,” she said direly.

“Helene, are you sure you want to do it? It must take a lot of nerve to marry me.”

“It doesn’t take nerve,” she said, “but it does seem to take time. I wonder how Malone is making out.”

“He’s probably finding out things that Von Flanagan doesn’t even realize he knows.”

They watched the lights on Navy Pier weaving a gold-laced veil over the water, finally turned off the Drive onto a dark street lined with smallish factory buildings and warehouses.

“There’s Tootz’ warehouse,” Jake said, pointing to a dark, three-story building.

“Where he keeps the hay for his horses?” she asked, peering at it curiously.

“No, it really is his warehouse. All that was left from the crash. Somehow he hung onto it.”

She drove on to the end of the street, turned around, and came slowly back.

“Why isn’t it used for something?”

“I don’t know. Some guy was making experiments there with a new kind of refrigeration for fruits. Built a swell freezing chamber, and then went broke and quit. We gave a party there once.”

“The kind of party that calls for refrigeration?” she asked.

“All of that.” He added a few details.

She slowed down suddenly, as suddenly stopped.

“Jake, if I’m not mistaken, there’s something going on there now that calls for refrigeration.”

“What are you talking about?”

“Look.”

He looked in the direction of the warehouse, jumped out of the car, ran across the walk, and peered in through the window. She followed him.

“What is it, Jake?”

“Looks like a fire. Not much of one, but a fire. We’d better go in and investigate.”

“We’d better send an alarm.”

“I want to take a look first.”

He rattled the door, finally picked up a stone from the gutter, broke the window glass, reached his arm inside, and turned the latch. The door swung open. Through the darkness, they could see a faint reddish flickering far in the back of the building.

“Helene, please wait here.”

“No. I’m coming with you.”

There was no time to stop and argue about it. He plunged into the darkness of the deserted building, Helene close behind him. Suddenly a rat scuttled across their path, and she screamed.
“Afraid of mice!” he flung back at her.

“That was no mouse,” she gasped. “It was a monster. Three feet long and eyes like balls of fire—Jake!”

“I see it,” he said. Ahead of them, the reddish flickering grew higher, brighter.

“No. On the floor!”

In the faint light, they could see that the dust on the floor had been disturbed. The trail led through the cobwebs to a great white door. Jake raced to the door, tugged at it frantically. It opened a tiny way and fell shut again. He made one more gasping, desperate effort, and it suddenly opened wide, fell back against the wall, and stayed there.

The faint reddish light, mingling with a bluish glare through the dusty windows, poured into a little white room, eerie and strange with its arrangements of odd-shaped pipes and tubes. Against its glaring whiteness, the thing on the floor seemed terribly dark. In one swift movement, Jake bent forward, turned it over. He stared at it, forgetting the fire that was crackling closer now.

“We’ve found Paul March!”
