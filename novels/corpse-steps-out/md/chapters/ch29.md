### Chapter 29

YOU’RE DAMN RIGHT. I’M NOT GLAD TO SEE YOU,” Jake said crossly, ushering McIvers into his room and kicking the door shut. “Last Sunday I started out to get married. This is Thursday night and, between one cursed murder and another, I haven’t got around to it yet.”

He lighted a cigarette and stared at McIvers. “How about a drink?”

“Thanks,” McIvers said. “I guess I could use one.”

“You look it,” Jake grunted. He dug the remains of a bottle of gin out of a dresser drawer and divided it with mathematical precision into two glasses. “I’m meeting my girl and my lawyer in just twenty-one minutes and possibly by the grace of God we
"I'll be able to get married tonight."

"Does it take a lawyer to get you married?" McIvers asked a little stupidly.

"No," Jake said, "he's just getting my girl out of jail." He pulled off his shirt and began searching for a clean one.

"But Jake," the agency man said unhappily, "everything is in such a mess."

"That statement has no news value whatsoever," Jake told him. He looked at McIvers closely. "Something's on your mind. You might as well tell me and get it over with."

"It's about Paul March's murder," McIvers said. "You see, I was there."

An act of providence saved Jake from dropping the glass of gin.

"I was there," the agency man repeated. "And about the warehouse, you know. There's a newspaper story about its burning down. If it burned down, Paul March's body should have been burned up in the fire, only how could it have been there if it was in St. John's kitchen, and anyway, how did it get there?"

Jake sat down on the edge of the bed and stared at him.

"It gets sort of complicated," McIvers said.

"Let's start this all over again," Jake said very slowly and calmly. "How did you know Paul March's body was in the warehouse?"

"God damn it," the agency man said wildly, "I put it there."

"Well, well," Jake said after a while. He began changing his socks. "You didn't shoot him, by any chance?"

"No. No, I didn't. He was dead when I got there. Jake, you've got to believe me."

"Sure," Jake said, "I believe you. I've formed a society for believing people who say they didn't shoot Paul March. But his murder seems to have been one of the major social events of the season. Hell's bells, everybody was there." He paused and added, "In fact, I was there myself."

"It was because of the script," McIvers said miserably. "I know I shouldn't have done it, but what else could I do?"

Jake gave up all attempts at dressing and said, "Getting information out of you is like getting an eyewitness story out of a disaster survivor. Do you want to tell me what happened, or do I have to hypnotize you to get it out?"

McIvers frowned. "It's sort of complicated."

"You said that before," Jake reminded him. "What's this about the script and what did you do that you shouldn't have done because there was nothing else to do?"

"Nelle had written some letters to Paul March," McIvers said, "and he was threatening to send them to Goldman, so I moved the body."

Jake looked at him for fifteen seconds, picked up the telephone, and told room service to send up more gin, and said, "Any more of this and I'll land in the paper-doll department, cutting up. You moved Paul March's body?"

"Of course," McIvers said. "What else could I do? It's not just that I like Nelle. Have you any idea how much commission I make off that show?"

"Sure, sure, sure," Jake said. "Go on."

"Nelle's script," McIvers said. "Just before the show, I got to looking through it to see about a change that should have been made. And look, Jake, here's how I figure what happened. She must have stuck the note between the pages of the script, and it was written in pencil, and the pencil came off on the script paper. It was in reverse, but I could read it."

Before Jake had time to wrestle with that, the gin arrived. "So it was you who stole the script?" he said, unwrapping the bottle.

"I was afraid someone else would find it," McIvers said. He took the glass Jake handed him. "Thanks for the gin. And then I was afraid Nelle would go over there between broadcasts, and I got to worrying, so I went over to Paul March's apartment, and he was dead." He paused long enough to gulp the gin. "Jake, why did she do it?"

"Maybe she didn't," Jake said. "But go on. You found him dead, and you did what?"

"I supposed, of course, she'd shot him. And I had no idea how many people might know she'd gone to his apartment between shows. Or how many people might know about the blackmail note. Or anything. And my God, Jake, imagine what would happen if Ne."
Lle was arrested for murder.”

Jake said, “I’ve been imagining it for several days. So you moved the body, huh?”

McIvers jumped up and began pacing the floor. “Damn it, Jake, I had to do something. There was the program to consider. It’s the major part of my income. The contract was up for signing again. And anyway, there was Nelle. Suppose—” He paused, gulped. “Good God, suppose poor Tootz heard anything about it! It would drive him crazy!” He paused and turned pale. “I mean—"

“Never mind,” Jake said. “I know what you mean.”

“I moved the body,” McIvers said. “I remembered the warehouse and the refrigerating chamber. It seemed like a perfect place. I drove my car around to the alley and carried Paul March down the stairs and out the back way, and went up and washed the kitchen floor, and took his body to the warehouse. It was locked, of course, but I didn’t have any trouble getting in. Then I went back to the rebroadcast, but I was late, and I just caught the tag end of it out in the lobby. Nelle sounded all right.” He stopped and stared at Jake. “You’re sure she didn’t shoot him?”

“Well,” Jake said, “she says she didn’t.”

McIvers nodded as though that settled everything. “Then the next day I began worrying about it. I was afraid March’s disappearance would make some stink. So I sent a note to his landlady with some dough, asking her to send his things to him at Honolulu, and signed his name.”

“Why Honolulu?” Jake asked.

“It was the farthest away place I could think of.”

“Australia’s farther,” Jake said. “But that might have been overdoing it.”

“But,” McIvers said anxiously, “somebody must have discovered the body and taken it up to St. John’s kitchen.”

“Yes,” Jake agreed, “somebody must have.”

“It was a crazy thing to do.”

“All of that,” Jake said with feeling. “But now what?”

“Now Goldman wants to see both of us—you and me—at nine o’clock tomorrow morning,” McIvers said anxiously. “Everything was rosy when we came back from Brule. We had a wonderful time fishing, and made all the plans for signing the contract after the show. And then all of a sudden he wants to see both of us tomorrow morning.”

“Probably doesn’t mean a damn thing,” Jake said, buttoning his shirt. “You’re just a little haywire because of what’s happened, that’s all.”

“If he had the faintest notion Nelle was involved in the murders, he wouldn’t sign.”

“He doesn’t have any such notion. He can’t have. And forget it.”

“But if the police are looking for her,” McIvers began desperately.

Jake spun around. “What are you talking about?”

“The police,” McIvers repeated. “Haven’t you seen the papers?”

“Not since morning.”

McIvers drew a folded paper from his pocket, Jake grabbed it.

Who Was Blond Girl In Radio Actor’s Life?

He read the story hastily. The police had learned of a mysterious and reputedly beautiful blond woman who had visited Paul March frequently during the winter. It was hinted that she might have more to do with his murder than met the eye. No clue to her identity had been disclosed, but Von Flanagan had stated he had a good idea who she was, and that he would have her brought in for questioning before the day was through.

“It means Nelle,” McIvers said in a tone that indicated it also meant ruin.

“Why the hell didn’t you tell me this at the beginning?”

“I didn’t think of it,” the agency man said miserably.

Jake tied his tie with a savage jerk, muttered that he hoped he might be married by Christmas, and said, “For the love of God, Joe, keep your mouth shut about all of this. No matter what happens and no matter what is said, deny everything. Leave Nelle to me, leave the police to Malone, and leave the rest to God.”

“But if it is Nelle,” McIvers said, “if it is, and if they do pick her up for questioning, and if Goldman does hear about it, and if—”

“If all that happens,” Jake said, reaching for his hat, “then we’ll all go to Australia and raise mink.”
