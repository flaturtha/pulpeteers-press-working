### Chapter 31
## A Night of Reckoning

Take reminded Nelle that she still had a program to do, induced her to lie down on Helene’s bed, and talked to her until she went to sleep. Then he sat by the window and devoted himself to worrying, until sometime near four in the morning when Malone telephoned.

The lawyer informed him that he was letting Von Flanagan keep Helene overnight. It would, he explained, keep his mind off Nelle Brown. Once Jake had delivered Nelle safely to rehearsal, he, Malone, would get Helene out without any difficulty.

Helene was, he added, having a wonderful time.

“She would be,” Jake said gloomily, and hung up.

He returned to his chair by the window and sank into a half doze filled with uncomfortable dreams composed of Goldman, the program, Helene, Tootz’s horses, and Von Flanagan’s mink.

In the morning he sent Nelle to the studio and told her to stay there, met McIvers, observed that the morning papers mentioned only “a blond woman” being questioned by the police, and went to call on Mr. Goldman.

The sponsor was a small, compact man with white hair and a benevolent face. This morning, however, it was less benevolent than usual, and very anxious.

He showed no indication to waste time discussing fishing, the weather, and what was the matter with the Chicago Cubs. To Jake, that was a bad sign.

“It’s this way,” he said, without preliminaries. “Jake, before I sign the contract tonight, I want that you and Joe should find out who done all these murders.”

“I’m afraid I don’t understand,” Jake said lamely.

“Oh yes, you understand,” said Mr. Goldman soothingly. “Oh yes, you do understand, Jake. Suppose I sign the contract tonight, and they don’t know yet who done these murders. And maybe tomorrow they find out Nelle, she is mixed up in the murders, or maybe even that she did them herself, only it seems to me like she was too much of a lady. But I’m just supposing, you understand. I ain’t saying Nelle is anyway mixed up with these murders, but this man Paul March, he used to be with the show and there was some trouble between him and her when he left it, and this St. John was with the agency, and there was always trouble between him and her. So now I don’t want to sign the contract tonight unless I know who done the murders, and that Nelle ain’t mixed up in it.”

He leaned back, folded his hands across his round little middle, and smiled at them benignly.

“But look here,” Jake said, “you can’t do this to me. I’ve arranged for a photographer tonight to take a picture of you and Nelle signing the contract. It’s to be announced in the program tonight that the contract is signed for another year. Why, it’s written into the script.”

“Well,” said Mr. Goldman mildly, “I guess maybe you could send the photographer away, and maybe take it out of the script, hmm?”

“Now look, Mr. Goldman,” said Joe McIvers in his most persuasive tone. “You know as well as I do that Nelle Brown couldn’t be involved in anything like this. Not Nelle Brown!”

“Maybe so,” Mr. Goldman said, “and maybe not so. How should I know? All I say is that I don’t sign the contract tonight unless I know who done those murders and that Nelle isn’t mixed up in it.”

Joe McIvers mopped his forehead.

“Now Mr. Goldman,” he said anxiously. “Even if by some wild chance Nelle was involved in this, you could trust Jake to keep it out of the papers. What is he hired for?” He looked hopefully at Jake.

“Sure,” Jake said, laughing hollowly. “I could hush it up no matter what happened.”

Mr. Goldman pulled his lower lip. “I don’t say you can’t,” he said.
Firmly, “Now look here. At home I've got a wife and two wonderful daughters. Every week they sit at home and listen to Nelle Brown. Every week they sit at home and tune in to the West Coast to hear the rebroadcast of Nelle Brown. Now how would I feel if they sat at home listening to Nelle Brown, and here she is mixed up in two nasty murders.”

“But she isn’t—" McIvers began.

Mr. Goldman silenced him with a gesture. “All over the country,” he said, “people sit at home with their families and listen to Nelle Brown. Now maybe tomorrow they pick up a newspaper and read that Nelle Brown is mixed up in a murder mess. Or maybe they don’t read about it, but she is just the same. For twenty years,” he said oratorically, “for twenty years I have been selling good candy to people. Ever since way back when all I had was a little pushcart and a box of chocolate bars.

Then—"

In patient and respectful silence, Jake and Joe McIvers listened to the frequently related story of how Mr. Goldman had risen from his pushcart to become the head of the Goldman Candy Company, with products for sale at all candy counters.

“And so,” he finished, “Joe, tonight you have my contract there for me to sign, and Jake, you have the photographer there to take the picture, but be sure you have the proof of who murdered those people and that Nelle isn’t mixed up in it in any way.”

“But what can we do?” Joe McIvers asked desperately. “The police are working on the case. What on earth can we do that the police can’t do?”

Mr. Goldman shrugged his shoulders. “How should I know? I only make candy. Maybe now Jake here can do something.”

“I’m a press agent, not a detective,” Jake said, “and there isn’t much time before tonight.”

“Well,” Mr. Goldman said, “you heard what I've got to say. That’s all.” He pushed a button on his desk, and a yellow-haired secretary popped in the door. “Jessie, bring me in those letters I should answer.”

“But Mr. Goldman,” McIvers began a little desperately.

“Look here,” Jake began, “you can’t expect—"

Mr. Goldman looked up from the letters on his desk as though surprised to find them still there. “Goodbye,” he said pleasantly, “I’ll see you tonight.”

The two men walked silently out.

“Fatheaded old imbecile,” McIvers muttered in the elevator. “When he gets set about a thing, you might as well ask the Wrigley Building to waltz as to try to move him.”

“No man who can start with a pushcart and make a million bucks in the candy business is a fatheaded old imbecile,” Jake observed. “Not as far as I’m concerned, anyway. But this puts us in a nice spot.” He sighed. “Maybe it’s just that I can’t think straight so early in the morning. Let’s go talk to Malone.”

They found the little lawyer eating breakfast in his office. McIvers told him of Goldman’s ultimatum, while Jake helped himself to Malone’s coffee.

“What do we do, Malone?” Jake asked.

“Send for more coffee,” the lawyer growled. He walked to the window and stood staring gloomily across the rooftops, while Jake sat wondering if Von Flanagan would take him as a partner on a mink ranch. By the time Malone’s secretary arrived with a thermos bottle of coffee, the lawyer seemed to have reached a decision. He sat down behind his desk and poured coffee into water glasses.

“Helene,” Jake asked anxiously, “where’s Helene?”

“At the broadcasting studio,” Malone said peevishly, “probably telling Nelle Brown how to sing. She put in the night telling Von Flanagan how to run the homicide squad.”

Jake sighed with relief. “At least she’s out of this mess.”

Malone nodded. “It was a matter of proving to Von Flanagan that she really didn’t know anything about Paul March,” he said, “and she contributed more to that than I did. Then a few hints to Von Flanagan that I might be very displeased, personally, if he didn’t forget the whole thing. Don’t ask me why that had an effect on him, because I won’t tell you. After all, some things are sacred.” He sighed heavily. “Anyway, Vo
In Flanagan was damned glad to see the last of her.

In spite of the worries on his mind, Jake grinned at the thought of the havoc Helene must have created at police headquarters. But the grin faded rapidly.

“Malone,” he began, wondering if his voice sounded as hoarse as it felt.

“Go on to the rehearsal,” the lawyer said wearily. “Act as though nothing at all had happened, and don’t let anybody get near Nelle Brown.”

“The contract—" Jake said.

“Have it there ready to be signed,” Malone told him.

Joe McIvers looked up, the first faint look of hope on his face. “Can you find out who the murderer is in the time we have left?” He paused, gulped, and added, “Do you already know?”

Malone looked at him and said nothing.

“For the love of God, Malone,” Jake began.

“Go away,” Malone said crossly, “Go away.”

“Do you know what you’re going to do?”

“I do,” Malone said, “and I don’t like it. But there’s no way out, now. Go away, I want to think.”

Jake paused a minute at the door. “Will we see you later?”

“You will,” Malone told him. “I’ll be at the studio.”

“Bringing the murderer with you, I suppose,” Jake said sourly.

“He’ll be there,” Malone growled. “Get the hell out of here.”

Jake muttered something about unwashed Irishmen and crooked lawyers, and slammed the door behind him.

“All we can do is hope for the best,” he told McIvers. “Malone knows what he’s doing. If he says he’s going to fix this up, he’ll fix it up, so we might as well stop worrying.”

“I suppose so,” McIvers said. “What shall we do now?”

Jake sighed. “This would be a perfect day to get drunk,” he said, “but maybe we’d better get on over to rehearsal.”

Schultz was sitting alone in the control room, munching a sandwich and reading The Daily Racing Form. He looked up as Jake came in.

“Where’d Nelle get the double?” he asked. “She’s a wonder. Sounds almost like Nelle herself.”

Jake looked through the window to where Nelle, still wearing the wig, stood by the microphone, arguing about a song arrangement with Lou Silver.

“I don’t know where Nelle got her,” he said, “but you’re right, she’s a wonder.” He looked around the studio. Yes, there was Helene in a corner, a copy of the script in her lap. The world became a little brighter.

“Of course,” Schultz said, brushing a crumb from his chin, “I could tell the difference, being an expert on Nelle’s voice, but I’d bet the average listener couldn’t. Will she do the show herself? Nelle, I mean?”

“God knows,” Jake said, “but I hope so. Look here, Schultz. We’re going in there and rehearse. You keep everybody out of here. I don’t care who wants to get in the studio or the control room. Keep ‘em out—all except a guy named Malone, a lawyer.”

“I get you,” Schultz said, “I won’t let nobody get in.”

Jake nodded, walked in the studio, and looked around. There was Helene, looking cool and exquisite in her corner; Nelle, more than ever resembling Miss Wilson from Lansing; Lou Silver, marking a last-minute change in an arrangement; Oscar Jepps, coatless, red-faced and perspiring; Bob Bruce, pale and worried; an actress whose name he couldn’t remember; two actors whose names he couldn’t remember; a bunch of musicians; Krause fiddling with his sound effects, and Baby. Baby? Oh yes, he remembered. Baby had a part in this week’s show.

Oscar saw him and walked across the studio. “What’s Nelle wearing the fur piece for?”

“She’s a fugitive,” Jake said, “don’t ask questions. How’s the script?”

Oscar said, “I could have written a better one in my sleep.”

Nelle joined them. “What goes on?” she asked, very casually.

“Listen,” Jake said, “as far as you’re concerned, this is just another rehearsal. I want Nelle to keep hidden out for reasons of my own. Schultz is keeping everybody out of the studio, so she might as well take off the disguise. Now get this. The whole mess is going to be cleared up this afternoon. I don’t know how myself, but it is. Meanwhile, there’s a show t
To do tonight. Forget the whole infernal business and rehearse the show. Now get going.”

He signaled to Helene to follow him into the control room, and settled down to listening.

For the first half-hour, rehearsal was strained and listless. By the time Jake began to give up hope of an even presentable broadcast, the group began to be too absorbed in the show to think of anything else. By four o’clock, the script had been shortened, lengthened, rearranged, and rewritten, and everyone rested and drank coffee. By five o’clock, a final rehearsal went off with a smoothness and vitality Jake would not have believed possible. As the musicians prepared to leave, he walked into the studio.

“Lou, you can get your boys out of here. You can go, too,” he said to the unnamed actress and actors and to Krause. “The rest of you stick around.”

“What’s up?” Bob Bruce asked.

Jake looked toward the control room and saw Malone. “I think we’re going to learn the truth about the murders,” he said.

“What murders?” Oscar said innocently, taking his face out of the script.

Jake sighed. “It must be wonderful to be an artist,” he remarked, and called into the microphone, “Come on in, Malone.”

The little lawyer walked into the studio. He looked very pale and very tired.

“You all know John J. Malone, I guess,” Jake said, looking around.

“Have you done something, Malone?” McIvers asked anxiously. “Is the contract safe?”

Malone nodded and sat down heavily in one of the leather-and-chromium chairs. “I know the whole story. I might as well be honest. I've known the important part for several days now.” He paused a moment. “There’s a way to handle it that will save things, I think. But I hate to do it. Because I know it’s going to hurt.” He paused again and looked up. “I’m sorry, Nelle. I’m sorrier than I can say.”
