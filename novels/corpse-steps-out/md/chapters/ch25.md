### Chapter 25

Jake inquired at the hotel desk for John J. Malone, was told that the little lawyer had come in a few hours before and gone up to his room. He looked at his watch, riding up in the elevator, and reflected that this was an ungodly hour to wake anyone. Still, what was the use of having a lawyer if you couldn’t wake him up before dawn to get you out of a jam. Especially a jam like this one.

The door to Malone’s room was ajar. The lawyer was fast asleep in a chair by the window, a little avalanche of cigar ashes on his vest. Jake shook him into wakefulness.

"What the hell?"
"Malone said, blinking, 'What the hell? Where did you go? I waited here an hour or so, and then I drove to Erie Street and couldn’t find you, so I stopped to watch a fire for a while, and came back here.'

'That was our fire,' Jake said proudly, 'too bad you didn’t stick around longer.'

He told Malone of the pursuit of Helene.

'Just our luck,' he finished, 'that damned waitress saw Helene and me around the place.'

'What were you doing there, for the love of God?'

'Carrying Paul March’s body out, so we could take it up to St. John’s house,' Jake said, lighting a cigarette and snapping the match toward the wastebasket.

The lawyer bounded to his feet, wide-awake now.

'Jake Justus, you’re drunk.'

'That may be,' Jake agreed, 'and it’s been said earlier tonight, too, but I know what I’m talking about.'

Malone paced the floor a minute or so. 'I might have known better than to let you two wander around alone, even for an hour or two. It’s God’s mercy you didn’t think of dynamiting the city hall. Did you really find Paul March’s body, and how did you do it, and where was it, and where is it now?'

'We really did, and it was in the freezing chamber of the old warehouse, and right now it’s leaning against the door of John St. John’s kitchen.'

He added the details of the night’s adventures.

Malone stared out the window, biting savagely at a cigar. 'It would have been simpler if you’d just gone ahead and gotten married, as you originally intended.'

'How was I to know?' Jake asked innocently.

'God only knows what’s going to happen now,' Malone said gloomily, sinking into a chair. He looked at Jake. 'You’d better get some sleep.'

'Hell, I can sleep anytime. How are we going to get Helene out of this mess? It’s my fault in the first place, and that doesn’t make me feel any better about it either.'

'For two cents,' Malone said irritably, 'for two cents I’d drop the whole thing and let you get her out of it yourself.'

'Filthy moneygrubber,' said Jake admiringly. 'What are you going to do, Malone?'

The lawyer sighed deeply. 'Oh hell, I’ll fix it up. But Helene will have to lie low until I do. The police captain at the Chicago Avenue station is a friend of mine. He knows you two, as you might have remembered. I’ll tell him how it happened, and get the whole thing dropped. Now get some sleep.'

'What’s going to happen when the body is discovered tomorrow? Paul March’s body?'

'Hell will pop,' Malone said darkly. 'I hope to God your pal Essie was able to get away with those letters.'

'I hope so too,' Jake said. 'I should have gone in and made sure, but I was too afraid of waking the guy.' He yawned and stretched. 'Maybe you’re right. Maybe I’d better go home and get some sleep.'

'Maybe you’d better stay right where you are,' Malone told him. 'The police might have a description of the blond pyromaniac’s companion. You wouldn’t be able to get much sleep in the jailhouse.'

Jake said wearily, 'I guess not.' He walked to the window and looked out. Grant Park was misty and mysterious in the vapors that rolled in from the lake. Like Helene’s dress, he thought. Cloud color. Beyond the lake, a faint line of rose marked where the sun was going to rise in a few minutes.

'This looks like a good day for getting married,' he said. He stretched again and lay down on the bed. 'Is there a drink in the house?'

Malone unearthed a bottle of gin from under a pile of shirts and poured some into a glass. Jake drank it gratefully.

'My God, I’m tired. Malone, you don’t think St. John’s implication in the Paul March murder is going to involve Nelle, do you?'

'How the hell would I know?' the lawyer growled, pulling off his shirt. 'You go to sleep. I’m going to take a shower and get some breakfast and go find out about things.'

'Wouldn’t it be one hell of a note if St. John hadn’t really shot the guy?'

'Wouldn’t it,' Malone said coldly.

'Well, you can’t expect me to think of everything. I'd.'
I don’t like St. John anyway. If he didn’t do it, let him prove it.”

“Shut up and go to sleep.”

The lawyer went into the bathroom and slammed the door.

The sound of the shower running made a pleasant accompaniment to Jake’s thoughts. Scenes floated before his mind in unordered succession: Helene, the broadcast, the bruise on Essie St. John’s shoulder, Helene, the moment when they had crossed the bridge one shuddering second before the barrier fell, lines of dialogue from next week’s script, Helene again.

He slept.

Hours later he woke, looked around him, tried to remember what had happened and why he was sleeping on Malone’s bed with all his clothes on. Something strange, something far from normal, had happened to his head. He wondered what it could have been, and if he would ever feel the same again.

He reached for the telephone, inquired about the time. It was half-past eleven. He laid down the telephone, wondering why he hadn’t simply looked at his watch.

One by one the events of the past night came back to his mind. He sat up and swung his long legs to the floor, watched the floor tilt sideways, spin a little, tremble, and settle back to normal. It was a little unnerving.

If Malone had any gin left, a drink would either make him feel better or worse.

Ten minutes later he decided that it had made him feel decidedly better.

Again he picked up the telephone, and called Molly Coppins. She reported that Helene was still sleeping soundly and that she would not, under any circumstances, let anyone bother her, including Jake Justus.

He helped himself to Malone’s razor, shaved, and took a shower. He was just tying the mildest of Malone’s neckties, his own being beyond repair, when the lawyer walked into the room. “Everything fixed up?” he asked.

“No,” the lawyer said sourly. “Everything is in a mess. Perhaps this will be a lesson to you. Perhaps this will teach you to let well enough alone. I doubt it, but I can’t help hoping it will.”

“Have the police arrested St. John for murder yet?”

“No. And they won’t. Not now, or at any future time.”

Jake spun around. “Why the hell not?”

“Because St. John is dead,” Malone said, tossing a folded newspaper on the dresser. “Because someone shot St. John last night.”

“Malone, for the love of God!”

“This morning the St. John maid walked in the back door, knocked over Paul March’s body, and was scared out of seven years’ growth. In the living room the radio was blatting away with some good-morning-cheer-up program. She rushed into the living room and there sat St. John in front of the radio, a bullet through his bean.”

“Malone,” Jake said desperately, “Malone, he must have been dead when we were there last night.”

He picked up the paper. A smudged and unflattering picture of John St. John adorned the front page.

Director Found Shot to Death Beside Radio Set

Jake glanced hastily through the story. The police, it seemed, were somewhat puzzled by the condition of Paul March’s body. He wondered how much it had thawed out before they arrived. The police had likewise fixed the time of the murder at some hour before midnight. This had been decided when it was found that the radio set was turned to a station which went off the air at twelve. Smart of them, he thought.

Another headline caught his eye.

Blond Pyromaniac Sought by Police

“Malone, what have you done about this damned mess Helene is in?”

“Nothing yet. I can’t be everywhere at once, and this St. John murder comes first. I’d rather get you out of a murder rap than an arson charge.”

Jake remembered something very suddenly. “Malone! The letters. Nelle’s letters. Did Essie get them before the murder?”

“Before the murder, or after it, or at the time of it,” Malone said. “At least the police didn’t find them in his pocket—I was able to learn that much, anyway. So I stopped at your hotel to find out if she’d left them for you, and she hadn’t. But I
I learned that the announcer, Bob Bruce, has been trying to reach you since four o’clock this morning. You’d better call him right away.”

Jake stared at him. “Bob Bruce? Why does he want to get in touch with me?”

“Probably wants to confess to the murders, and thinks you have a sympathetic face,” the lawyer said crossly. “Why don’t you call him up and find out?”

Jake picked up the telephone and called Bob Bruce.

“Oh, thank God,” the announcer said, his smooth, overtrained voice harsh and desperate. “Get over here right away, will you? I can’t tell you over the phone. But there’s one hell of a jam.”

“Wait, Bob. Let me bring Malone with me. Malone, the lawyer. You know him.”

“Lord, yes. He’s just the man we need. But hurry, will you? This is an awful mess!”
