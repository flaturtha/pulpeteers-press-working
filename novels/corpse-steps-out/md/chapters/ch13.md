### Chapter 13

“Pull yourself together,” Jake said. “He still may be able to make it.” He hoped his voice carried the conviction that he didn’t feel.

“But if he doesn’t,” Nelle said desperately, “if he doesn’t—" She paused, frowned. “I could do this. I could do such a lousy job of the audition that Givvus wouldn’t buy the show for marbles.”

“You could,” Jake said, “but it probably wouldn’t do any good.”

“Givvus might insist on another audition, which would mean we had a little more time.”

“I doubt it like hell,” Jake said. “He’s heard you on the air. St. John said the audition was a mere formality. And anyway, baby, I don’t think you could do it. I hate like the devil to compliment you, but I don’t think you could do that bad a show.”

She smiled at him wanly.

“Don’t worry,” Helene said vaguely and helpfully.

Oscar appeared in the reception room, his round moonface shining with sweat. “Scripts ready.” He wiped his brow. “This is awful.”

“At least there haven’t been any fights in rehearsal,” Jake said consolingly.

Oscar nodded. “That’s what worries me. They aren’t really putting their hearts into it.”

Jake started to follow him to the studio. A page boy touched his arm.

“A lady to see you, Mr. Justus.”

Essie St. John was waiting by the elevator, her homely face pale with anxiety.

“Jake, where can we talk? I mustn’t
He opened a door leading out of the reception room, led her into the seclusion of the stairway.

“Jake, I had to warn you.”

“Of what?” Jake said stupidly.

“I don’t know what. That’s the trouble. You must think I’m nuts. But John’s up to something. I can tell. That nasty, pleased way he acts when he’s up to something.”

Jake nodded. “It’s all right, Essie. I know all about it. He is up to something, but he isn’t going to get away with it.”

Her cape slipped aside and as she moved to retrieve it, Jake caught the outline of an ugly bruise on her shoulder.

“Essie, why don’t you leave him?” ‘I would if I could,” she said dully. “Jake, he’s told me again and again that if I do, he’ll divorce me, and bring all sorts of horrible things out in court. He can do it, too.” She patted aimlessly at her hair. “I couldn’t help going out and having a little fun once in a while. You don’t blame me, do you? But he knows all about it, and I don’t dare leave him.”

Jake patted her arm a little awkwardly.

“Someday I'll decide to shoot him,” she said in a tired voice.

“I’ll buy you the gun,” Jake promised.

She smiled weakly. “I’ve got to know how things turn out today. But I don’t dare let him know I’m here.”

“Wait in the little girls’ room,” Jake said. “I’ll send Nelle in to tell you about it, when it’s all over.”

He gave her elbow a reassuring squeeze and walked back to the control room.

Rehearsal dragged on dispiritedly. Oscar Jepps went through all his tricks: was by turns insulting, cajoling, enraged, unhappy. None of them did any good. It was midafternoon when he looked up at the clock and announced, “Dress rehearsal.”

Dress rehearsal was not quite so bad as Jake had expected, though Nelle went to pieces on the obbligato passage.

In the interval that followed, St. John slipped away to usher Mr. Givvus into the sanctity of a client’s room down the hall, where he would listen to the audition in peace, privacy, and a restful atmosphere. The sound man went to phone the hospital. Schultz went out to buy a chocolate bar. Lou Silver went to make a date with the studio hostess. Bob Bruce went to put cold water on his forehead. Nelle came into the control room, sat down at the black-and-chromium desk, and laid her head on her arms.

“Jake, I'll have to do a deliberately bad job. It’s the only way.”

He laid a hand on her shoulder.

“And it kills me to do it, Jake. You’d understand why. But the rest of the gang wouldn’t. Oscar and Lou and Bob, and even Schultz. They’d always remember I’d done a lousy job of an audition.”

“Maybe they’d understand too,” he said.

“Well damn it,” she said, “I’d always remember it. Even with things as they are. I’ve never done a show badly in my life.”

“That’s just pride,” he told her.

“All right, damn it, it’s just pride.”

She rose wearily and paced the little control room while Oscar shooed the musicians and audition cast into the studio, located Schultz and the sound man, and began explaining a last-minute change in the script to Bob Bruce, who didn’t look as though he understood it. Schultz put a bag of almonds on the desk and sat down by the control board. Finally St. John arrived, limping ever so slightly.

“Why aren’t you with your client?” Nelle asked irritably, picking up her script.

“He wants to listen to this alone,” St. John said, “and besides, I don’t entirely trust you. I want to be here where I can keep an eye on you.” He looked at her coldly. “Too bad you haven’t a trained voice. You might be able to come within a few feet of hitting that obbligato.”

Nelle started to speak, closed her mouth grimly, reached up with a sudden motion, grabbed St. John’s long thin nose between her fingers, and pulled it until he forgot his dignity and yelped. Then she walked stiffly into the studio.

It was, Jake thought, the only happy moment of the day.

St. John retired to a chair in the corner. No one dared look at him.

“All set,” Schultz called into the comm.
Communicating microphone. He looked at his signals and saw that the client’s room was ready.

They were not all set. The sound man was missing again.

Someone located him. Oscar looked over the studio and saw that everyone was present. “Everybody ready?” he called.

“No,” Lou Silver said.

The tuba player had the hiccups.

At last Schultz gave the signal, Bob Bruce gave another signal, there was a long sweeping chord on the harp, and Nelle’s voice came floating into the control room.

Exactly three minutes later, Schultz jumped, gave another signal that silenced everyone in the studio, and grabbed the communicating microphone.

“Start over. I forgot to pipe you into the client’s room.”

Oscar’s groan came through the loudspeaker like a blast from a riverboat. St. John said crossly, “Why don’t you know your business, Schultz?”

Schultz jumped up. “All right, damn you, you can get another operator.” He started for the door.

Jake grabbed his arm. “Sit down, Schultz. For the love of God, let’s get this over with.”

Schultz hesitated, grumbled, sat down, made motions with plugs and switches. The signals were made again. The long sweep of the harp strings was repeated. Once more Nelle’s voice filled the control room.

The audition was finally underway.

Jake thought he had never seen Nelle quite so pale. And no wonder. A lovely spot to be in, he reflected, simply lovely. With the fierce pride of the artist, to do a deliberately bad job would be a thing she’d remember forever. To do a good job would be to cut her own throat.

He listened anxiously till she approached the obbligato passage in her first song. She came to it, her voice picked it up and carried the notes superbly, perfectly, triumphantly. That was the moment when the rest of the cast caught her spirit, and the show began to move.

As the last notes of the closing theme died away, Jake decided that the audition had been as close to perfect as any show Nelle had ever done.

Malone had certainly better find Goldman now!

He walked into the studio, Helene at his side, and saw that Nelle knew how good a job she had done. She was very white, and her eyes were tired. He took her arm firmly.

“Jake—"

“Yes, I know. Nelle, we’ve got to stall somehow. Helene, you go phone Nelle’s apartment, tell the butler to phone here in about ten minutes with the news that Tootz has had a stroke. We’ll have to rush Nelle to his bedside.”

“But at six o’clock,” Nelle began, “at six o’clock, when the option expires—”

“At six o’clock, you’ll be shut in a room with Tootz, and a white-clad nurse and a bearded doctor are going to tell St. John that no one can go in under any circumstances.”

“Jake, I love you,” Helene said.

They walked out of the studio together. St. John met them at the door, his pale face smiling.

“I knew your good judgment would assert itself, Nelle. Now come along and talk things over with Givvus. You too, Justus.”

“Sure,” Jake said lightly, “why not?”

He told Helene to wait for them in the reception room, squeezed Nelle’s hand reassuringly, and followed St. John down the hall.

The agency man paused at the door to the client’s room. “No funny business, now.”

“Don’t worry,” Nelle said wearily. “I know when I’m licked.”

They opened the door and stepped inside. Mr. Givvus sat, his back to them, before the loudspeaker. He did not rise, nor even stir, when they came in.

“Mr. Givvus,” St. John began.

Still the man did not move.

Jake walked over to him. Mr. Givvus was slumped a little in his chair. Just behind his right ear was a small, very neat bullet hole.

The audition had been wasted on the late Mr. Givvus.
