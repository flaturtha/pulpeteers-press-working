### Chapter 28
## Love Hurts

“Well, we didn’t learn much from Von Flanagan,” Malone said on the way to Nelle’s apartment. “Just that Mr. Givvus sent Paul March five hundred bucks, and that if Von Flanagan ever lays hands on you, God help you.”

“Damn it,” Jake said indignantly, “I wasn’t the first person to move Paul March’s morta."
Only one question remains. Somebody else started this juggling process. Malone, why did Givvus send the money to March?”

“You’re as good a guess artist as I am,” Malone said noncommittally. “Offhand, I can think of several dozen reasons, and none of them seem in the least reasonable.”

“Malone, you’ve got to do something!”

“I am going to do something,” the little lawyer said.

“What?”

“I’m going to move to Australia,” Malone said sourly, “and raise mink.”

They found Nelle in the big, paneled living room, talking animatedly to a tall, slender girl. The girl had bobbed black hair, wore eyeglasses attached to a wide ribbon, and was dressed austerely in a gray tailored suit.

“Hello,” Nelle said happily, “I’m so glad you finally got here.” She didn’t bother to introduce the black-haired girl. “I've just been telling the story to this young lady from the Times.”

“You’ve been doing what?” Jake asked in a dazed voice.

“It’s very interesting that she was really the one to find Paul March’s body,” the young woman said. Her speech was high-pitched and affected. Jake disliked her at the first sound of it.

“My God, Nelle!”

Nelle looked at him with wide, hurt eyes. “Oh, Jake! Did I do wrong?”

Jake groaned. “Damn it, Nelle, you know I never want you to talk to reporters. You know I handle all these things myself. And now—" The implications of what she had done grew in his mind with a mounting horror. “After I’ve practically broken my neck, risked a jail sentence, and God knows what else besides, just to keep you out of the newspapers, you go and pull a fool stunt like this and ruin everything—” He stopped and wondered what the hell Nelle was laughing about.

“This will teach you to label me a pyromaniac,” the young woman said in Helene’s voice.

Jake looked at her, at the black, bobbed wig, the eyeglasses, the tailored suit. Probably for the first time in his life, he was speechless.

“Well, after all,” Helene said, “you couldn’t expect me to sit around with my hands folded.”

“Where in the name of God did you get the wig?” Jake said. His voice hadn’t quite recovered.

“Molly borrowed it from a girl who works in a burlesque show. The nice young man next door went to the dime store and got the glasses for me. The suit belongs to a model who lives on the floor above. Who is going to be arrested for St. John’s murder?”

Nelle looked up, her face suddenly grave. “Yes, Jake. Tell it all quick before Tootz gets through being shaved and comes in here.”

Jake told them what little they had learned from Von Flanagan.

“Nelle, where were you last night?” Malone asked.

“But I didn’t kill him—"

“I never said you did. I want to know what kind of an alibi you’ve got.”

“I went to see Baby. Bigges drove me there and went off someplace and then came back and got me. I got home a little after midnight.”

“A wonderful alibi,” Jake said sourly. “It’ll look nice in print, too.”

“All right,” she said irritably, “I had a headache and couldn’t sleep so Bigges took me for a drive and brought me home again.”

“That’s weak, but it sounds better.”

“Jake, the police don’t suspect me, do they?”

“I don’t think so,” he told her, “but you’re bound to be questioned. You get this into your head and keep it there. One, you only knew St. John in a business way. Two, you haven’t any idea who might have wanted to murder him. Three, you were riding around with Bigges last night.”

“But Jake. The copies of my letters. Where are they?”

“I wish to God I knew,” Jake said soulfully.

“Find the murderer and you’ll find the letters,” Helene said. “They were in St. John’s pocket yesterday afternoon.”

“Oh Jake,” Nelle said desperately, “Tootz mustn’t know about any of this. Or Baby. But especially Tootz. If either one of them should find out, I’d drop dead.”

“Or if Goldman or your public find out, we’ll all drop dead,” Jake said gloomily, lighting a cigarette.

They heard a door close somewhere in the apartment.

“Here comes Tootz.”
Nelle whispered.

The handsome, white-haired man walked in and greeted them. He looked a little uncertainly at Helene.

“You know me,” Helene said. “I’m me.”

He stared at her. “But you’ve done something to your hair.”

“It’s a wig,” Helene said.

Malone said, “She’s disguised.”

Tootz smiled and nodded as though that explained everything. “Oh, I see. It’s a very good disguise.”

“It has to be,” Helene said, “I’m being followed. Jake and I were followed everywhere last night, and I thought we’d never get away, so today I disguised myself.”

Tootz looked around wonderingly, finally caught Jake’s eye, surreptitiously tapped his forehead, glancing at Helene. Jake nodded slowly, almost imperceptibly. Tootz’ mouth formed a round O.

“Some of these cases are terribly sad,” he murmured softly to Malone.

“Sad,” Malone said with feeling, “is hardly a strong enough word for it.”

Tootz glanced at the newspaper on the table beside him. “I suppose you’ve read all about the murders,” he said.

Jake cleared his throat. “Yes. We were just talking about it when you came in.”

“A horrible thing,” Tootz said fastidiously. “I suppose you all knew St. John. I can’t say I liked the man, but it’s a terrible way to die. It seems to me, the other name—March—sounds familiar, but I can’t quite place him.”

“He was an actor and director,” Jake said lamely. “I didn’t know him very well myself.”

“Neither did I,” Nelle managed.

“It seems to me I’d met him,” Tootz said, pondering. “I know I did.” He drew his brows together and was silent a moment. “Oh yes, I remember now. It was at a party. Nearly a year ago. Remember, Nelle? He seemed rather charming. Too bad this happened.”

Malone had been studying a chess problem on the board by the window; he chose that moment to ask Tootz’ opinion of it. Tootz slipped into the chair by the chessboard. It was a difficult and involved problem, and the two men discussed it at great length.

“I’m glad you dropped in,” Henry Gibson Gifford said happily. “I was getting lonely.” He sighed. “It’s a fine day out. I wish I dared go walking. But Nelle hasn’t wanted to go with me.”

“You know,” Malone said thoughtfully, studying a chessman, “I’ve been thinking about those men following you. I think something ought to be done about them.”

Tootz nodded gravely. “Something should. But what could be done? Perhaps the police could help.”

“I don’t think the police would do much good,” Malone said. “They’re so stupid about things like this. Perhaps I could, though. I’ve had a lot of experience in one way or another.”

A light came into Tootz’ eyes. “Do you think you could?”

“Well,” Malone said, “I could try. Have you ever thought of doing anything yourself?”

“What?” Tootz asked helplessly.

“For instance,” Malone leaned over the table and said very confidentially, “have you ever thought of shooting them?”

Henry Gibson Gifford stared at him, a puzzled look in his fine gray eyes. “But that would be murder.”

“Yes,” Malone said reflectively, “yes, it would. But it would be justified as self-protection. Or you could shoot at them, and frighten them away.”

“I could, couldn’t I!” It was as though a sudden ray of hope had crossed the handsome old face. “I could do that. And if they didn’t pay any attention, then I would have to really shoot. I hate to think of it, but I could.”

“It’s a suggestion, anyway,” Malone said, picking up a chessman and putting it down again.

“Only—" Henry Gibson Gifford paused, frowned. “I haven’t any gun. I’d have to get one. Yes, I’d have to get one. I must speak to Bigges about it.” He smiled at the little lawyer. “Thank you very much for your advice, Mr. Malone. I appreciate it greatly.”

Conversation went back to the chess problem. At last Malone signaled to Jake that he was ready to leave, and they rose to go, taking Helene with them. At the door, Jake managed one last warning to Nelle, to sit tight and say nothing.

“I wish I had my car,” Helene grumbled as they hailed.
In a taxi, Malone asked, "Are you going to get me out of this mess, or aren't you?"

He checked his watch. "I'll do it now. Andy will be at the police station. In fact, I'll even take you with me, wig and all."

"Wonderful," Helene said. "I ought to marry you instead of Jake."

"While I'm doing it," the lawyer continued, "why don't you, Jake, go have a talk with Baby. He'll probably be freer with you than with me. Find out if there's anything he knows that we don't know."

Jake scowled. "I hope he doesn't."

"So do I, but we're leaving no worm unturned," Helene corrected. "Malone, is Tootz a homicidal maniac?"

Malone replied, "Hell no. And in any case, I can only see these murders being committed by a sane man."

Jake left them in front of the remodeled mansion where Baby lived, promising to meet them at the corner bar in half an hour.

Baby, looking pale and tired, greeted Jake. Jake wondered if he had slept the night before, or if anyone had. Except John St. John, of course. The young man seemed relieved to see him.

"Jake," he said, "I need your advice. Do you think I ought to go to the police and confess to these murders?"

Jake dropped the cigarette, picked it up, and finished lighting it before responding.

"Is that your idea of fun," he asked, "or did you do them?"

"No," Baby replied. "But eventually the police will find out who really did, and it'll be all right. And in the meantime, it will help Nelle."

"You aren't real," Jake said. "People like you don't happen. You've been reading the wrong kind of magazines. Look here, kid, suppose Nelle herself is really guilty?"

"But she isn't. I knew she couldn't be when I read in the papers that both St. John and Paul March were shot with the same gun. I knew she didn't shoot St. John because she was here last night. So, of course, she couldn't have done the other. She couldn't have anyway. Not Nelle. I should have known—" His voice broke off suddenly.

"What should you have known?" Jake asked.

The young man buried his face in his hands. "I've been an awful fool. All this time I've been thinking Nelle killed Paul March, and then Mr. Givvus, and I've been nearly going crazy."

Jake stared at him. "But nobody knew about Paul March's murder until this morning."

"I did," Baby said miserably. "I knew it all along." He looked up, his face strained and white. "Jake, that night—the night of the broadcast—I'd been over at a friend's apartment listening to the show, because my radio was on the fritz. It was over and I was just walking home along Erie Street when I saw Nelle get out of a taxi in front of the building there."

"Did she see you?" Jake asked.

Baby shook his head. "I started to call to her, and then I stopped. I knew she was going to see Paul March. Or I supposed she was. I wasn't sure. I waited there for her to come out. This all sounds crazy, but you do crazy things when you're as jealous as I was that night. Finally she did come out and went away. I was nearly wild, wondering if she'd been to see him. I thought I'd just go in and see if he was there. I thought that if he was there, then I'd feel sure she'd been to see him. So I walked up to his door. It was just a little open and I—went in. Oh hell, I don't know what I thought I'd say to him or do to him. I just went in. And there he was, dead." He looked up at some indeterminate point on the ceiling. "I supposed Nelle had shot him."

Jake walked to the window, watched two taxicabs and a truck roll down the street, turned back again. "Good God," he said, and again, "Good God! And you've been carrying this around on your back all this time!"

"I couldn't say anything to her, could I? I couldn't do anything, could I? I just had to keep still. And then the day of the audition—" He paused.

"Go on," Jake said.
Aid.

“I knew the secret audition was going on. And I was just coming out of Studio B and I saw Givvus going into the client’s room with St. John. And I just sort of figured it out myself—that St. John was making Nelle give the audition. I knew she wouldn’t want to do such an audition. I wasn’t sure how St. John was making her do it, but I knew he must be. And then I read in the paper that Givvus had been killed.”

“And you thought Nelle killed him!” Jake said.

“What could I think?” the young man said wildly. “What could I think? I know now I was wrong, but still that doesn’t help much. My God, Jake, what am I going to do? I can’t just not do anything at all about it.”

“All you can do is keep your mouth shut, and be nice to Nelle,” Jake told him. “She’s having it tough right now. Are you in tomorrow night’s show?”

“Yes. Oscar called me this morning.”

“Good. Just stick around and—well, be nice to her. That’s all you can do.”

“I know she doesn’t love me,” Baby said, “but that doesn’t make any difference. I’d do anything. Anything, Jake.”

“No, she doesn’t love you,” Jake said gently, “and she never will. She’s in love with a dream, and she always will be. Right now the dream happens to look like you. She means every word she says to you now. But someday the dream will change and look like somebody else. Maybe we all love only imaginary people, I don’t know. But certainly Nelle does. And when the change does come, you’re the one it’ll be tough on.”

“No it won’t,” the young man said. “I can remember her, can’t I?”

Jake shook his head pityingly.

“You think I’ll get over it,” Baby said, “but I won’t.”

“You’ll remember her,” Jake said, getting up. “But your own dream will change. Hell, what are we looking into the future for? The present is bad enough.” He sighed. “The truth is, the only person Nelle really loves is Tootz, strange as it seems.” He paused at the door. “Keep your mouth shut and try not to worry.”

Baby nodded. “I will.”

Down on the sidewalk, Jake glanced at his watch. There would be time to walk over to his hotel and change his clothes before he met Malone and Helene again. Not, he told himself, that he was getting dressed to get married. To think that would be to tempt providence. But sleeping in his clothes had not improved them any.

Something had to be done about Baby. In the past, Nelle’s romances hadn’t bothered him. This wouldn’t, as far as Nelle herself was concerned. But sooner or later the young man was in for a blow. A bad blow. Perhaps if he talked firmly to Nelle, she’d ease Baby down and end the whole affair. Nelle wouldn’t want to hurt anybody if she could help it. Or perhaps he could convince Baby that his presence on the scene was harmful to Nelle and get him to go away. It had to be ended somehow.

Hell’s bells, why was he wasting his time over it? As if he didn’t have enough on his mind anyway. Perhaps by this time Malone was getting Helen squared with the police. They would meet for dinner in a little while now, and he would be able to forget Nelle, Baby, the police, the murders, and everything else for a few hours.

He walked into the lobby of his hotel. A tall, gangling young man rose from a chair near the door and came to meet him.

“Thank God you got here,” Joe McIvers said. “I’ve been going nuts!”
