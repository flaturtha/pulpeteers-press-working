### Chapter 2
## Blackmail on AIR

The Tall Thin Man in the Little Control Room of the broadcasting studio stretched his long legs uncomfortably under the black-and-chromium table, absent-mindedly mussed up his red hair with a carelessly straying hand, and tried to focus his tired mind on the implications of what had just been said to him.

The forty-seventh broadcast of the Nelle Brown Revue had ended in a burst of applause from the studio audience. He forced his thoughts back over past events: Schultz, the control engineer, had made a final twisting of dials and switches, grabbed his hat, and gone hurrying off to get a sandwich between shows. Joe Mclvers, from the advertising agency, had popped out of the booth like a cork out of a bottle to phone the sponsor. The usual procession of actors, musicians, sound men, and assistants had filed out of the studio.

Then Nelle Brown had blown into the little glass booth like a small tornado, her face dead-white against her deep-rose dress, her eyes smoking with fury. She had kicked the door shut, cursed the apparatus that kept it from slamming, and said, “Jake, I’m being blackmailed.”

There had been a pause while he stared at her, before she lit a cigarette, took one long puff, stamped it out below the no smoking sign, added, “I’m damned if I will!” and vanished.

The import of what she had been saying began to take form in his mind. Suddenly he sprang to his feet. Part of the duty of a press-agent manager, he told himself, was to keep one’s client from being blackmailed.

What the devil had happened to Nelle Brown this time?

There was no sign of her in the corridor. He stopped a page boy.

“Miss Bro
"Excuse me, sir? Try the reception room."

She was not in the reception room.

"Nelle? I saw her beat it down the elevator."

He caught the next elevator. It was crowded and stopped at every floor like an old-fashioned milk train. Nelle was nowhere in the lobby, nor in the bar, nor the restaurant, nor the cigar stand.

Jake Justus, press agent, manager, and ex-reporter, wondered again why, with untold billions of people in the world, everything had to pick him to happen to.

He lit a cigarette and tried to think. Nelle hardly ever left the studios between broadcasts. Could she possibly have gone home? But why the hell should she do that?

He might try it anyway, if he could manage without alarming Tootz, in case she hadn't gone home.

He stepped into the cigar stand, called Nelle's apartment. No one answered. He stood holding the receiver a long time, finally put it down, and methodically called every place Nelle might have gone.

After half a dozen calls, it was apparent that she had vanished into the very thinnest of air.

Damn it! He had to find her. He looked at his watch and frowned at its reminder of only forty minutes left until the rebroadcast for the West Coast.

Just at that moment, the idea came.

It was almost impossible. No, by God, it wasn't at all impossible. That was the one person most likely to be blackmailing Nelle. Why the devil hadn't he thought of it before, instead of wasting all this time? He ran out to the curb, hailed a taxi, gave the driver an address on Erie Street, and told him for Pete's sake to make it snappy.

The taxi stopped before a long, dark building. Jake told the driver to wait, bounded up the steps into a many-cornered hall, and climbed the unlighted stairs to the second floor. The air resounded with riotous tumult from one of the apartments, a very devil of a row. He grinned. He'd gone to a few parties in that building himself! For a moment he wished he didn't have the rebroadcast to attend. Not that he knew the people giving the party, but that would make no difference. Then he remembered his errand, and stopped grinning.

He knocked at a door marked 215 and waited. There was no answer. He noted a light shining through the transom and knocked again, louder. Hard to hear anything, with that infernal racket going on. He gave one last, violent pound and the door, slightly ajar, fell open.

Nelle was not there. No one was in the room.

He went in slowly and cautiously, wondering what to do next. Then he saw it in the kitchenette, crumpled on the floor—the man Nelle Brown might have come to see, the man who might have been blackmailing her—a dark huddle on the linoleum, in a little pool of blood.

The man was dead. Shot, Jake thought grimly, and not half shot. Nothing could be done for him now.

He stood there a moment, one hand twisting the shabby green curtains of the kitchenette. The thought of calling the police rose to his mind and was instantly dismissed.

Blackmail or no blackmail, why had she done it?

He reminded himself this was no time to spend thinking it over. Nelle might have left some trace of herself. Moving quickly and carefully, he looked through the room. There was nothing.

At last he went cautiously through the dead man's pockets, found no souvenir nor reminder of Nelle Brown. There was a surprisingly fat packet of twenty-dollar bills in the dog-eared wallet, and Jake scowled. Where the devil had all that money come from? The man had been broke, hungry broke, a week ago. Now, here was a fistful of folding money. Jake felt a pang of sympathetic regret. For all the man had been a rat, it was a damn shame he wouldn't have the spending of all that money, after being broke so long!

Oh well, as long as there was nothing of Nelle's in the place.

He looked at his watch. Fourteen minutes to the rebroadcast.

He gave the room one last, hurried look, saw that he had left no trace of his own visit, left the door slightly ajar just as he had found it, and ra
Ced to his waiting taxi.

“—And step on it, fella!”

The driver nodded, shot down the street, and immediately became hopelessly embroiled in a traffic jam.

Where was Nelle Brown?

Jake Justus cursed himself as the stupidest of all stupid fools. Why hadn’t he gone there to look for her in the first place? Why hadn’t he managed to find her, wherever she had gone? Or, failing to find her, why hadn’t he gone back to the studio and arranged for a double for the rebroadcast?

Now they would all be in the soup, unless someone had had sense enough to rise to the occasion, which he doubted. Again he took out his watch. Six minutes now. What would they do? Probably throw in a substitute program of sorts, and the sponsor, dear Mr. Goldman, would have a litter of leopards. Hell would be calm and quiet compared to what was going to pop. How was he ever going to get Nelle out of this mess?

The taxi dumped him out at the door with less than a minute to go.

He raced across the lobby, dived into a waiting elevator, and gasped, “Late. Nelle Brown rebroadcast.”

The elevator operator, used to emergencies, nodded, slammed the door, and the car shot upward without a stop.

The elevator stopped at the studio floor, and Jake stepped into the reception room just as someone turned on the loudspeaker. A voice, warm and rich and dramatic, calm as a lake at early evening, and absolutely unmistakable, filled the room.

“Golden Moon ... over the midnight sky. ...

Relief flooded over him in a great, almost unbearable wave. He leaned against the wall a moment, catching his breath.

Of all the silly things to have imagined! Just because one of Nelle Brown’s ex-sweeties managed to get himself shot, he’d practically had Nelle strapped in the electric chair. The idea of Nelle Brown murdering anybody! She probably hadn’t even been near the place.

He slipped into the control room, mopping his brow. Schultz grinned sympathetically, waved him into one of the uncomfortable black-leather-and-chromium-piped chairs.

There she was, standing beside Bob Bruce, the announcer, her face upturned, singing. There was not a tremor, not even the faintest suggestion of a tremor, in her voice.

Wherever she had gone between broadcasts, she had returned safely and in plenty of time. Not one shining wave of her golden-brown hair was disturbed; her exquisite, flowerlike face—though as pale as it had been before—was newly powdered. Her deep-rose dress was fresh and unwrinkled.

But her handkerchief!

Her immense, pale-green chiffon handkerchief that she passed nervously through her hands as she sang had an ugly stain in one corner.

It had not been there when she left the studio.

Even through the heavy glass of the control-room window, Jake Justus could see that it was blood.
