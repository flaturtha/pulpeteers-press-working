### Chapter 18

Malone knew the desk sergeant at the Chicago Avenue Police Station and managed to convince him of a good reason why the big imported car had been left there overnight between two no parking signs. Then he delivered the car to Helene, suggested to her that his life would be simplified if she took up bicycling, and went in search of Daniel Von Flanagan.

The big police officer was red-faced and wilted by the heat, and very tired. He welcomed Malone's suggestion of a cool drink in some quiet place as a marooned mariner might have welcomed the Coast Guard.

Von Flanagan was a weary, exasperated, and unhappy man. He was, as he explained to Malone, only an honest cop trying to do his duty; and the police department, the D.A.'s office, and the newspapers seemed to hold him personally responsible for the fact that people would murder each other in complicated and devious ways.

"Just a nice straightforward shooting, I can understand," he said dismally into his beer, "but why people should go out of their way to make life so hard for me, I don't know."

"It's probably nothing personal," Malone said.

"Now you take this dame who shot her husband," Von Flanagan went on. "She shot him in the kitchen of their house, there was nobody else in the house, the neighbors called a cop, she had the gun that had killed him, and everybody knew she hated his guts. It was all nice and simple. No fuss, no bother. I arrested her, and you defended her, and she was acquitted, and I understand she's going to marry a guy who owns a chain of taverns on the West Side. Nice fella, too. Now that's the way I like to see things happen. Quick and clean and simple."

"So many people do everything the hard way," Malone said sympathetically.

"Hard for me, you mean," Von Flanagan said. "If I had it to do over again, I'd of been an undertaker like I intended to be in the first place. Believe me, if our alderman's wife's brother hadn't owed my old man money, I'd of never been a cop. Now you take this guy who was found shot up in Lincoln Park. He's been driving me nuts all day." He sighed heavily.

"What about him?" Malone asked. "I didn't read much about it in the papers, just the headlines."

"More beer," Von Flanagan said to the waiter, "and listen, Gus, you'd better bring 'em two at a time. A park-district cop named Leo Gadenski was going along the walk near the viaduct and he seen this guy asleep on a bench. So he goes to chase him off, only this guy ain't asleep, he's dead." He sighed again, more noisily. "It's an awful mess."

"Why?" Malone asked disinterestedly.

"Because there ain't no reason for nob."
"Nobody shooting the guy," Von Flanagan exploded. "Nobody wants to shoot him. He comes from Philly, and he's rich, and he makes soap. That's a hell of a lot to find out about a guy, now isn't it? I ask you. Nobody knows him in Chicago. Nobody ever heard of him in Chicago. And God damn it, nobody knows why he came here." He looked moodily into his glass.

"That don't make sense," Malone said.

"I know damn well it don't make sense. Look here. This guy flew here from Philly yesterday and got in around noon. We know that. He registered at the Drake, went up to his room and washed—all he had with him was a little handbag with a shaving kit and a clean shirt—went downstairs and had lunch, and walked out the door. We know that. And then what? Then he turns up in Lincoln Park, on a bench, dead."

Malone decided there was a special providence that looked after Jake Justus. He called for another beer.

"Sounds like he came here on a business trip," he hazarded cautiously.

Von Flanagan nodded. "Yeah, but what business? No one knows anything about it. His company has a sales office here, and no one in it even knew he was in town. He didn't intend to stay long; he had reservations on the midnight plane." He paused to brush a fly off his cheek. "I've got a little money tucked away, and next year I'm gonna retire, and do you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna raise mink."

"Mink?" the little lawyer repeated stupidly, his mind still wrestling with the problem of Mr. Givvus.

"Yeah, mink. Annie's been hounding me for a mink coat for three years, so last winter I priced one, and do you know what those damn things cost?"

"I'll tell the world I do," Malone said bitterly and reminiscently. "Can you learn anything from Philadelphia?"

"Hell no," the police officer said. "Nobody there knew where he was going. He told his office he was going to be away for a day, and that was all. Whatever he came here for, he was sure keeping it dark."

"Maybe somebody followed him here," Malone suggested.

"Do you suppose we didn't think of that?" Von Flanagan said scornfully. "We checked his wife, his kids, his in-laws, his girlfriend—boy, was she a handful—his business associates, even his bookie. Nobody followed him to Chicago. Nobody even knew he was coming to Chicago. I tell you, Malone, it don't make sense."

"Well," Malone said, "it's like this. He probably went for a walk in the park and sat down on a bench to rest. Somebody was shooting at birds, or tin cans in the lake, or some damn thing, and plugged him by mistake. Probably don't even know it."

Von Flanagan nodded. "Sure. That's easy. So easy I thought of it myself. Only here's the thing, Malone. He wasn't shot on that park bench. He was took there."

Malone raised an eyebrow, drew a long breath, and said very slowly, "That's funny."

"Funny ain't the word for it."

"How do you know he was taken there?"

"Because," Von Flanagan growled, "when Gadenski found him he'd been dead anyway an hour. Well, we found a couple who'd been sitting on that very same park bench not fifteen minutes before Gadenski found the body." He loosened his tie and went on, "Naturally there was all hell popping when the body was found, and this couple was walking along the beach, and they came up to see what all the rumpus was about. And the guy, he says, 'Why, we were sitting on that bench a few minutes ago.'"

"I see," Malone said, nodding, and wondered why Jake Justus's special providence didn't keep its mind on its work.

"So," the police officer finished, "he must have been shot somewhere else, and somebody carted him up to Lincoln Park, and sat him on the bench. Now will you please tell me why the hell anybody would do that?"

"Why indeed," Malone murmured.

"Why not leave him where he was? Or if he had to be carted away for some reason, why sit him up on a bench in Lincoln Park, with his hat on his head, and why the hell stick a newspaper in his lap?" Von Flanagan mopped a
Steaming brow. “I tell you, Malone, nobody would do a thing like that who wasn’t just plain ordinary nuts!”

“You,” said Malone soulfully, “are telling me.

Von Flanagan waved to the waiter for more beer. “See what I mean? It’s things like that make life hard for me. Now you take mink. They don’t give you no trouble. They’re healthy, if you take good care of them. And—”

“What are you going to do about the Givvus case?” Malone interrupted.

“I’ve sure as shooting got to do something. I’m getting hell about it.” A grim look came into his mild blue eyes. “And I’m gonna do something, too. I’m an easygoing guy, going along minding my own business and not looking for trouble, and it takes a lot to get me sore, but I’m sore about this case, and what I mean is, I’m good and sore. Maybe I’m just a dumb cop. All right, so I’m just a dumb cop. But by God, I’m gonna find out who shot that guy and took him up to Lincoln Park.”

“I sure wish you luck,” Malone said heartily and hoped that heaven would forgive him.

“I’m gonna fine-toothcomb that guy’s life and find out why he came to Chicago. Somebody knows why, and I’m gonna find out. I’m gonna plaster his picture all over the papers. Somebody’s gonna remember seeing him. I’m gonna find out where he went when he left the Drake if it’s the last damn thing I ever get done.” He set his jaw hard. “I don’t care how long it takes, either. And don’t think I can’t do it, because I can. I’m sore about this, that’s all. It ain’t right for people to do things like this to me, and I’m God damned if I’m gonna stand for it.”

Malone remembered past instances of Von Flanagan’s dogged persistence when his ire was roused, and decided that the next few days were going to be busy ones. Still, he tried one hopeful shot.

“You might,” he said thoughtfully, “be able to put over that accidental death theory and get the newspapers off your tail.”

Von Flanagan shook his head. “Sure I could. But I ain’t going to. Not this case.” He set his glass down with a thump. “Now, you see what I mean, Malone? It’s things like this that make it hard for a fella. Next year I quit, so help me. All you have to do is buy a nice little farm somewhere and get two mink, and then just wait. That’s all. We’d better have some more beer.”
