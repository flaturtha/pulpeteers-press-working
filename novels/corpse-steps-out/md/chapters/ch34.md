### Chapter 34

In Von Flanagan's dingy little office, Henry Gibson Gifford, otherwise Tootz, had finished telling his story of how he had eluded the watchful eye of Nelle Brown and shot and killed Paul March, Mr. Givvus, and John St. John, because they were persecuting him. Something told him to do it, he explained. He produced the gun that had shot March and St. John, apologized for having lost the gun that shot Mr. Givvus, and gave the one he had to Von Flanagan with a little sigh of regret. The only thing he didn’t confess to, Malone said later, was Helene’s driving through a red light.

“We should have known it,” Von Flanagan said to Malone. “We knew Nelle Brown had a husband who was a little over the sill, but we never thought he’d go completely off. We should have seen that these murders were committed by a nut—anybody with half an eye should have seen it right away.”

Malone smiled modestly.

“This sure is tough for her,” Von Flanagan said sympathetically. “We’ll make it as easy as we can for her. Not much fuss, a simple commitment. Everybody knows he’s been crazy for months. Yes, we’ll make it as easy as we can for her. Did you get me her autograph?”

“I will,” Malone promised.

Von Flanagan turned to Henry Gibson Gifford.

“How’d you come to pick those particular guys?”

Henry Gibson Gifford leaned forward confidentially. “I thought I had to shoot everybody who had anything to do with the radio program. Everybody. I had to. Only Mr. Malone convinced me I ought to tell you about it first.”

Von Flanagan nodded sympathetically.

“It beats all how a frail little guy could have moved those bodies,” he said reflectively.

“Bigges never knew I had the car,” the old man said boastfully, “and I’m strong. I wanted to hide them all in the old warehouse, but I was afraid. It made a nice fire, the whole warehouse. I wish I could see another fire.” He sighed regretfully. “Mr. Malone says I’ve got to go away somewhere. But I don’t mind. It’s all right as long as I can take the horses with me.”

Von Flanagan looked up, puzzled. “Horses?”

Henry Gibson Gifford looked all around the room, and smiled. “Horses. My horses.” He said it so convincingly that for a moment the police officer caught himself looking around to see if they were really there. Then his eyes met Malone’s in a long glance of deep and sympathetic understanding.

There were only those last few minutes before the show went on the air. Jake Justus stretched his long legs in the control room and wished the next half-hour was safely over.

Papa Goldman had been extremely sympathetic. The occurrence would make Nelle Brown a heroine in the eyes of her public. Malone had promised that the story would not break until after the rebroadcast for the Coast. In the meantime, there would be the show; after the show, the contract would be signed. Right now the photographer was waiting in the studio lobby.

Everything was settled, everything was serene. Nelle was out of trouble. The contract would be re-signed. In—he looked up at the control-room clock—thirty-three minutes and fifteen seconds the show would be over.

That is, if Helene had managed to get Nelle back to the studio in time! For a horrible moment, he thought of everything that might happen—accidents, arrests, traffic.
Fic Jams.

In the studio, Bob Bruce, serene and smiling, was making his regular weekly spiel about the show, the star, and the sponsor, and "Quiet in the studio, please, except when laughter or applause are indicated." Bob Bruce was pale, but his face was happy. He was going to see Essie St. John after the rebroadcast.

Joe McIvers tiptoed into the studio, his long, thin face pleasant and relieved.

Everyone was happy, Jake thought, except Nelle. Nelle was the one who had been hurt. How would she ever go through a broadcast after what had happened in the afternoon? But she would. She'd make it the show of a lifetime, so that listeners all over the nation, picking up their newspapers tomorrow morning, would remember it. After the broadcast, what?

There was Baby, standing among the members of the dramatic cast, anxiously watching the studio door. What was it Baby had said? Oh yes. "When it does come, if somebody like me is there—" Well, he was there. Someday Nelle Brown would abandon him as casually and carelessly as she would abandon a song she had sung too many times, but this was Baby's hour.

Even in the glass booth, he was aware of the sudden hush, the breathless expectancy that had come over the studio audience.

"—And here she is herself, ladies and gentlemen, the star of Nelle Brown's Revue—Nelle Brown in person!" (Applause cue.)

There she was, and Jake sighed with relief. She was back in time.

The control-room door closed behind him, and Helene slipped into the chair by his side.

"Special permission to sit in the control room," Schultz said with a grin, offering Helene a chocolate.

How pale Nelle was!

The sign-off of the program just ending came suddenly from the control-room loudspeaker. Jake held his breath.

There was the station break, and the chimes. Then Schultz made a sudden, rapid twisting of dials, a quick, emphatic signal to the studio, whispered, "Take the baby," as though they could hear him through the pane of glass, and drew a bag of salted peanuts from his pocket to eat during the show.

And then her voice filled the little, silent room—warm, rich, dramatic, and calm as a lake at early evening.

"Golden moon—over the midnight sky—"

Jake suddenly remembered one line he had intended to suggest revising.

Well, there was no revising to be done now.

He settled back in his uncomfortable chromium-and-leather chair, and laid his hand over Helene's.

Twenty-nine minutes and forty seconds later he reflected that it had been the best show of the series. Everything was settled, everything was perfect. It was just a great big wonderful world.

All except one thing.

He sat straight up in his chair and swore unhappily.

There wasn't time to drive to Crown Point and be married between broadcasts!

The End.
