### Chapter 30

Malone and Helene were waiting for him. She was still wearing the black wig, which was now slightly askew.

"Your wig is a little woppijawed," he told her, adding, "So Malone couldn't get it fixed up for you."

"He got it fixed up all right," she said. "I've even got the car back. But I've grown so attached to this wig that I won't give it up."

"Alright," he said, "but I'm damned if I'll marry you while you've got it on. I have a feeling it wouldn't be legal."

He told them McIvers' story on the way to the Erie Street building. Malone listened silently.

"I have a feeling just like Von Flanagan," he grunted at last. "All this is being done just to make life hard for me. So McIvers moved Paul March's body to the warehouse. Then who burned down the warehouse?"

"The man or woman who murdered Paul March," Jake said.

"How did he or she know Paul March's body had been moved to the warehouse?" Malone asked.

After a long pause, Helene said, "The murderer's maternal grandmother was a Welshwoman, and he or she has second sight."

Molly Coppins was waiting for them in the lobby.

"Jake, the building has been full of policemen all afternoon."

Jake nodded. "I know."

"It's about Paul March, poor devil," she sighed. "To think of my packing all his things and sending them to Honolulu, and all the time he was lying somewhere, dead. Who killed him, Jake?"

"I don't know," Jake said.

Malone sat down on a corner of the desk. "What did they want to know about him—the police, I mean?"

"Oh, everything. Who his friends were, and what he did, and all about him. I didn't know much to tell. He was a sort of unsociable cuss, always kept a little to himself. I don't like people to be like that." She beamed affectionately at Helene.

Helene sighed and said, "Well, I'm glad they've stopped looking for me, anyway."

They went upstairs to Helene's apartment. Jake looked at his watch.

"If we left now," he began, "there ought to be just enough time to drive to—"

"Don't say it!" Helene begged. "I have a feeling that the minute you mention Crown Point, hell will pop somewhere else." She laid the wig on the table, shook out her long, straw-colored hair, and began combing it.

Malone had pulled a crumpled envelope from his pocket and was drawing squares and triangles in the corners.

"Jake," he began slowly, "the Nelle Brown Revue came off the air at nine o'clock, right? And the rebroadcast went on the air at eleven?"

"Right both times," Jake said promptly.

"In between broadcasts—" the lawyer paused, scowled. "Nelle left the studios right after the broadcast. She would have had time to get here while the shot-and-shell program was going on. But we'll assume for the time being that March was already dead when she arrived. In that case, she must have just missed meeting the murderer on his way out."

"And just missed meeting Baby on his way in," Jake said.

"Then," Malone said, "you horsed around trying to figure out where Nelle was, and finally ended up here. After looking the situation over, you beat it back to the studio, with only a few minutes before the rebroadcast. Meanwhile, McIvers thought things over and was the next arrival on the scene. Did McIvers get back to the rebroadcast?"

"No," Jake said.

Malone scowled at the notes he had made on the envelope, finally crumpled it up, and threw it into a corner. "It all fits in two hours," he announced. "But why did McIvers take so long to get over here?"

"I can tell you that one," Jake said. "The first thing Joe did after the broadcast was to go phone Goldman, the sponsor. Knowing Goldman, I'd say that probably took some time. And Joe's anxiety over what Goldman had thought of the show would keep his mind pretty well occupied for a spell. That happens every week. After he'd phoned Goldman and settled back to normal again, he began to worry about Nelle Brown and the blackmail note and eventually got over here."

Malone nodded. "Give us sent five hundred bucks."
"Checks to Paul March," he said thoughtfully. "Paul March was murdered by persons unknown. McIvers played boy scout and moved the remains. Givvus came here for an audition and somebody shot him. Finally, St. John was killed—with the same gun that killed Paul March, but not the gun that killed Givvus."

Jake picked it up from there. "If St. John and Paul March were shot with the same gun, I’d hazard a guess that St. John didn’t kill Paul March. There was more than five hundred bucks in Paul March’s pants. So possibly St. John bought the Nelle Brown letters from Paul March."

"And where are they now?" Malone asked. "Who wanted them enough to murder St. John for them?"

"You’re asking the questions," Jake said. "You can answer them."

"One more question," Malone said. "Do we want to find the murderer?"

"What do you mean?" Jake asked angrily. "If we don’t find him, how are we going to get the letters back and get Nelle Brown out of this mess?"

"The problem is this," Malone said. "Suppose the murderer is someone we don’t want to find. Grant that St. John is well out of the way. Grant that Paul March is, too. Mr. Givvus seems to have been a perfect nonentity, no one mourns him. How far do you want to go to get Nelle Brown out of a mess?"

"You mean," Jake said, "the murderer may be someone we sympathize with, someone who was perfectly justified in killing."

Malone didn’t answer.

"But Malone," Helene said, "murder isn’t ever justified."

"Isn’t it?" the lawyer said very quietly.

No one answered for a long time.

"The point is this," Malone said at last, "if it’s possible to sit tight and do nothing—devote ourselves to making sure that Nelle’s place in this picture doesn’t become known either by Tootz or Goldman or by the general public—then that’s the course of action. Eventually someone else will be murdered somewhere and somehow, and everyone will forget this, maybe even Von Flanagan."

He was interrupted by the door opening suddenly.

They turned, and saw Nelle Brown standing in the doorway, big-eyed, breathless, and very pale.

"Jake," she said, her voice strangely flat. "Jake, the police."

Malone bounded up, shut the door, and led her to a chair.

"They came up to the apartment," Nelle went on. "Lucky Tootz didn’t hear. Bigges went to the door and they said who they were. Bigges heard me duck in my room and he thought quick and said they’d find me at the studio. So they asked him a lot of questions and went away. But they’ll find out I’m not at the studio and go back. Oh Jake, what shall I do?"

"You dad-ratted idiot," Jake said indignantly, "you should have stayed there and let them question you."

"I couldn’t, Jake. I’d seen the papers. I know they think I’m—I’m the blond woman. Oh Jake, between having the show to do tomorrow night, and the script for it doesn’t look very good either, and the contract to be signed, and now all this mess, I’m almost crazy. I couldn’t stand their asking me a lot of questions now. And suppose they took me somewhere for questioning and the newspapers got hold of it—"

"It wouldn’t look so hot," Jake said slowly. "Nelle Brown picked up by police for questioning in Paul March and St. John murders—no, it wouldn’t look so hot."

"And Goldman would know, and he wouldn’t sign the contract," she said desperately, "and Tootz—"

"What’s Tootz going to think if the police go back to your apartment looking for you?" Jake said. "What if they go in and ask him a lot of questions?"

"They won’t," Nelle said. "I thought of that. He was restless and not feeling very well anyway, so before I left, Bigges put him to bed and gave him a sedative that’ll keep him asleep for hours. If the police go back there, they won’t be able to wake him up."

"I want to see that contract signed tomorrow night," Jake said very thoughtfully. "I have a hunch that once it’s signed, we’ll be safer. If the story does get to Goldman after that, he probably won’t do a thing. Not."
Only will Nelle be a valuable property but he’ll feel it necessary to protect the show’s reputation. So the thing to do is to keep the police from catching up with Nelle until after the contract is signed.”

“Very nice,” Malone said, “but how? They’re probably out looking for her right now.”

At that minute there was a knock on the door.

“If it’s the police,” Jake said, “we give up.”

It was not the police. It was the young man from next door, offering beer. Helene welcomed him and told him to close the door. The young man stared suddenly at Nelle.

“I hope I haven’t gotten you into any trouble,” he said slowly.

“Was it you?” Nelle asked. “Was it you told the police that I’d come here to see Paul March?”

The young man looked unhappy. “It was. I didn’t realize I was doing any harm. I didn’t tell them your name, but I told them you were pretty and a blonde.”

Jake thought fast. “They’d probably discovered Paul March used to be with Nelle’s show, and had been seen at parties here and there with Nelle, and when this dope here said ‘pretty blonde’ they immediately said, ‘Ah, Nelle Brown.”

“I am a dope,” the young man said, “and I’m terribly sorry. If there’s anything I can do now—"

“Sit down,” Helene said absent-mindedly, “and shut up. I’m thinking.” She poured out the beer.

“The hell of it is,” Jake said, “they’ll probably come here, too. Because when they can’t find Nelle, they’ll naturally look for me to see if I know where she is, and when I left the hotel tonight, I left a message that I’d be here in case anyone tried to reach me.”

“Jake, you’ve got to do something quick,” Nelle begged.

Helene was looking at her very thoughtfully. “We’re going to let the police find you,” she said very slowly, “and you’re not a blonde. Come out in the bathroom and let me wash your face.” She grabbed the black wig from the mantel, shoved Nelle into the bathroom, and shut the door. From behind it Jake could hear water splashing.

“It won’t work,” Malone said morosely.

“Wait and see,” Jake said, sipping his beer.

A few minutes later Helene returned, triumphantly leading the transformed Nelle. The radio singer’s golden-brown curls had completely vanished under the bobbed black wig. But that was the smallest part of the change, Nelle Brown had become a very ordinary, pale-faced young woman with dark hair, a small, colorless mouth, and pale eyes behind thick eyeglasses. It seemed to Jake that she had even become smaller and thinner.

“You see?” Helene explained. “The main point is washing off the make-up. It’s unbelievable how different a woman looks with her make-up off. Nelle looks like an underfed schoolteacher.”

“The important thing is that she doesn’t look like Nelle Brown,” Jake said. “Besides, the police won’t have seen her except in photographs. Her voice would give her away though. Nelle, keep your mouth shut.”

“I will.”

“You can stay here tonight,” he went on. “Tomorrow you can go to rehearsal in that getup. The explanation will be that Nelle Brown is ill and her voice double is rehearsing for her. That’s pretty weak, but once you’re actually in rehearsal, nobody can get in the studio. It’s a chance,” he said thoughtfully, “but the one chance.”

“Even looking like that,” said the young man from next door, “she’s wonderful!”

Nelle sat down beside him and began getting acquainted. Helene turned on her radio and then turned it down so low that no one paid any attention to it. Jake and Malone took turns going to the corner for beer. It was nearly eleven o’clock, Helene was discussing with Malone the merits of using gin as a chaser for beer as against using beer as a chaser for gin, when there was a knock on the door. Jake opened it, and ushered in Von Flanagan, accompanied by a weary and morose policeman.

Jake introduced Helene, the black-haired girl (my cousin Miss Wilson, from Lansing, Michigan), and the young man from next door, whose name turned out to be Willie.
Wolff von Flanagan decided he was among friends, sat down, accepted the combination of gin and beer, waved the morose policeman to a chair, and complained bitterly that all people did was conspire to make life hard for him.

“And you, Jake Justus,” he concluded, “do you know where this Nelle Brown woman is?”

Jake shook his head. “I wish I did. Have you tried her home?”

“We’ve been there,” von Flanagan growled. “We’ve been everywhere. Nobody knows where she is. I’m sick of this damn running around after her. When I do find her, I’m going to throw her in the can.”

“On what grounds?” Malone asked.

“She’s a material witness,” von Flanagan said. “She came here to see Paul March. This young man here said she did.”

“I didn’t say it was Nelle Brown,” the young man said.

“Well, it sounds like her to me,” the police officer growled. “He worked on her radio program, and she’s the only blonde we can find who knew him.”

“It wasn’t Nelle Brown,” Helene said suddenly. “It wasn’t.” To everyone’s amazement, she suddenly burst into tears.

“What the hell!” von Flanagan said.

“I didn’t want Jake to ever know,” Helene said through her sobs, “because we’re going to be married, and now you’ve gone and ruined everything.” She wept noisily.

“You mean,” von Flanagan said dazedly, “you mean you were the blonde?” He added absentmindedly, “Stop crying.”

“But I didn’t shoot him,” Helene sobbed, “I haven’t been here for months. Have I, Willie?”

Willie Wolff picked up his cue. “No. No, you haven’t.”

“You knew it was her all the time and you didn’t tell me,” von Flanagan said loudly to the young man. “I oughta arrest you, too.”

“I didn’t want Mr. Justus to find out,” Willie Wolff said hastily.

Helene’s weeping became louder.

“Now, now, now,” von Flanagan said soothingly. “Don’t cry. Just be calm, and let me ask you a few questions. I said, stop crying. That ain’t gonna do you no good. Stop it, I tell you. I’ve got some questions to ask you. Stop it. God damn it all,” he said in a voice that could have been heard halfway across the lake, “Shut up!”

Helene gulped and was obediently silent.

“Now,” von Flanagan said triumphantly, in a tone that conveyed that he knew how to handle these women. “Now you can come along with me, and we’ll just have a nice little talk, you and I.”

“Look here,” Jake said, “you can’t do that. She’s staying right here.”

“Are you telling me what to do?” von Flanagan asked angrily.

“Jake’s right,” Malone began. “You can’t—”

“You keep out of this,” von Flanagan told him.

“Damn it,” Jake said, “I won’t have it.”

“You shut up,” von Flanagan roared. “That was all I needed, to have you butting in. Come along, sister. We’ll see whether I can take you with me or not.”

Helene stood up.

“All right,” Malone said, “but I’m going with her. I’m her lawyer.”

“I’m going, too,” Jake said.

“No, you aren’t,” Malone said. “You stay here, Jake.”

Jake thought a moment, looked at Miss Wilson from Lansing, and agreed.

“Don’t worry,” Malone told him, “I’ll fix everything up.”

Von Flanagan snorted, suddenly also looked at Miss Wilson from Lansing. “You, young lady. Did you ever know Paul March?”

She shook her head.

“What’s the matter,” the police officer asked, “can’t you talk?”

She found a handkerchief, coughed into it, and said in a hoarse and almost indistinguishable voice, “Got a cold.”

“Too bad,” the policeman said sympathetically, “nasty thing, in this weather. Do you know anything about Paul March?”

“No,” said the hoarse voice, “nothing.” She coughed again. “I just came down from Lansing for my cousin’s wedding.”

That seemed to satisfy him. He nodded, said to the morose policeman, “Come along, Konkowski, we got stuff to do,” took Helene by the arm, and marched out, Malone following.

The door closed behind them, and heavy footsteps sounded on the stairs. Jake looked accusingly at Miss Wilson from Lansing.

“On top of everything else,” he said, “just when I’m about to get married.”
Ed, you go and get my girl thrown into jail.”

Her eyes filled with sudden tears. “Oh Jake, I cause you so much trouble. Jake, I’m so sorry. I know I'm nothing but a nuisance.”

He patted her shoulder. “Never mind, babe. It’s all in the day’s work. What have you got a press agent for, anyway? Only we ought to change my contract to Jake Justus and family!”
