### Chapter 32
## Truth Beneath Lies

“What are you talking about?” Jake asked. His voice seemed to come from some perfect stranger.

Malone didn’t appear to hear him. He was looking at Nelle. The radio singer seemed to know what he was going to say. She turned very white.

“It isn’t worth it,” she said. “The contract, the show—nothing is worth it. Nothing in the world.”

Malone looked up at her. “It’s for you to say,” he told her.

“Nelle,” McIvers said wildly, “Nelle, the contract.”

“Shut up,” she said, as casually as though she were slapping a fly. “The program doesn’t matter anymore. It all seemed so important all along, and now suddenly it isn’t.” She turned to McIvers. “Joe, you can sell Goldman something else. It’ll take a little time, but you can do it. I'm sick of the whole thing anyway. I’m through. I’m not broke. I've saved a hunk of what I’ve earned this year. Enough for Tootz and me to live on for a while.” She flung an arm out in a wide, frantic gesture. “I don’t want much. Just Tootz. Just a little corner somewhere—where we can settle down and just live and forget all this, and be together, and perhaps find a little happiness someone else hasn’t used up. I’m getting out. I’m through with all this. I don’t give a damn who murdered Paul March, or Mr. Givvus, or John St. John. I don’t give a damn what happens to the program, or the contract, or me. The hell with it all.” Her voice broke suddenly.

Oscar Jepps laid a huge paw on her shoulder. “Nelle—”

She didn’t seem to know he was there.

“I’m sorry, Nelle,” Malone said again. “I’m sorry. It was the only way. And it’s too late to stop things now.”

He looked toward the door. All their eyes followed his. The door opened slowly, very slowly, and Henry Gibson Gifford, very dignified, very beautifully dressed, and very debonair, walked into the studio.

“I’m glad I heard your speech, Nelle,” he said quietly, “even though you didn’t mean it for me.” He laid his hat and stick on a chair, very deliberately.

“You heard it!” Nelle said.

“Through the loudspeaker,” he explained, “in the control room. The operator had you still—hooked up is the word, isn’t it?”
"It?"

"But how did you get here?" Nelle asked. "You didn’t come here alone! You couldn’t have—"

"I telephoned him," Malone said wearily. "I telephoned and said Nelle was in danger of arrest. I thought he’d come here. I had to find out, someway, if he’d go out alone, without Nelle. I mean—I had to prove it. I knew."

"Oh no," Nelle said, "no. It can’t be this way."

"It was the only thing I could do for you," Henry Gibson Gifford said very simply. He reached in his pocket, took out a little package, and gave it to her. "This is the only thing I have ever been able to give you. I meant to send it anonymously. Perhaps this was the better way after all."

She took the package almost mechanically, released the rubber band that held it, saw that it contained letters.

"But where," she began, and stopped. "Where did you get these?"

"From John St. John’s pocket," Malone answered.

Jake’s hand groped for a chair. "You mean," he said, "you mean that he—" He paused and frowned. "But Malone, you said yourself that he wasn’t—mad. Not that kind of madness."

"These murders were committed by a sane man," Malone said. "That was the key to the whole thing, that he was sane."

His eyes and the fine gray eyes of Henry Gibson Gifford met in a look of understanding that excluded everyone else in the room.

"When did you know?" the white-haired man said.

"It was Jake who told me first," Malone said. "It was Jake who made me see the whole thing." He turned to Jake. "First, when you said, 'It’s a good thing Tootz isn’t sane, or this situation would drive him crazy!'"

Jake nodded slowly.

"That told me," Malone said, "and then there was another thing, more definite. Tootz would not go out of the apartment without Nelle. That was pointed out to me time and again. Yet on two separate times when Jake telephoned the apartment, no one answered the telephone. Tootz would have answered if he had been there. And both times, we knew that he was not with Nelle. Obviously, he must have gone out alone. If he would do that—he was sane."

"I don’t understand at all," Nelle said.

Malone smiled at her very gently. "When you married him, he was a very wealthy man. He adored you. He looked forward to giving you everything you wanted. Then suddenly he lost everything.

"You came home and told him you’d signed the contract for your program. He was just realizing that he was through, finished. Suddenly the whole situation was reversed. From then on you’d be supporting not only yourself but him, and the whole world would know. That afternoon—was the first time Henry Gibson Gifford thought he saw horses in the living room."

There was a long silence.

"You mean," Nelle said, "he pretended?" Suddenly she flung herself on her knees in front of Tootz’ chair, grasped his hands. "You pretended, all the time? You never saw any horses? Not any at all?"

"Not any horses at all," he said softly, "nor any men following me." He looked over her head and smiled at Malone. "You must admit the horses were a very nice touch, though."

"They were," Malone said. "A very nice touch."

"But why?" Nelle demanded wildly. "Why?"

He stroked her soft, shining hair very tenderly. "Perhaps I should simply have gone away. Perhaps I should have gone out a window, as so many men did. But you were too precious to me, Nelle. Precious, and I felt too that you needed me. Yet—I couldn’t simply stay on and be the bankrupt husband of Nelle Brown, living on the income from her artistry. I could stay and be a harmless old madman. Do you understand? Do you forgive me, Nelle?"

"You talk of forgiveness," Malone said, "after what you have done for her."

"The imaginary men following me," the old man went on, continuing to stroke her hair, "were for another reason. I wanted to know all that was going on. I knew you were as impulsive as a child. I thought there might be a time when you would need help, protection perhaps. When everyone believed I would."
"I couldn't leave the house without Nelle, I always had a perfect alibi whenever Nelle was away.”

Jake looked up. “That’s what’s been fooling me all along,” he said.

The white-haired man nodded. “I didn’t plan it as an alibi for murder. But it came in very handily. I planned it so that I could keep an eye on Nelle.” The graceful old fingers paused, half tangled in her hair. “I knew all about Paul March. It all but broke my heart that I couldn’t comfort you when you needed it so. I knew all about”—he looked up to smile at Baby—"this young man. Those things haven’t mattered. Only your goodness to me mattered.”

Nelle was very still, her face buried on his knee.

“I knew what Paul March was, and I was afraid for you. Then that night a week ago you brought your script home, and I glanced through it and saw the impression left by his note to you. I knew, then, that the only thing to do was to kill him.”

Jake had never known that a room could be so still.

“I remembered the program that came just after yours, and I was sure the sound of the shots in that program would cover the sound of mine. I was confident Paul March would have his radio on, turned to your program, and I was right. I was in the hall just as your program finished, listened for the start of the other one, and walked in without knocking. He was in the kitchenette. I went up to him and shot him.”

There was a long silence. Jake felt Helene’s hand, very cold, slip into his own.

Henry Gibson Gifford drew a long, sighing breath. “The letters were in his pocket. I looked for any other reminder of you, Nelle, and found nothing. But I found money in his wallet, and that bothered me. I knew you hadn’t come and bought the letters. Finally I concluded he must have been blackmailing someone else.

“Just then I heard your steps in the hall. I hid out on the fire escape and watched you search the room.”

She looked up suddenly. “Then I was being watched when I was in that room! I felt it—and yet I thought it wasn’t possible.” She caught her breath sharply. “I was watched—and by you!” She buried her face again.

The old man went on as though there had been no interruption. “There was now another danger. Your coming to the apartment might involve you when the murder was discovered. Then this young man”—he indicated Baby—"came, and I stayed on the fire escape until he had gone. Then I stayed there trying to think what to do, and while I was there, first Jake arrived, and then Mclvers. I stayed out on the fire escape nearly two hours while a perfect procession of people came into that room.” He paused and smiled. It was almost like watching a parade.”

Jake cleared his throat harshly. “All that was needed was a guide and a rubberneck wagon.”

Tootz’ gray eyes met his appreciatively.

“Then I,” Joe Mclvers began, and stopped to stare at the old man. “You must have thought I was insane.”

Henry Gibson Gifford shook his head. “I understood why you were doing what you did. But when you moved the body of Paul March, I followed you and saw you hide it in the old warehouse.”

Joe Mclvers blinked. “I didn’t dream that anyone was watching me—following me.”

Tootz smiled. “I was very quiet.” He paused and drew a long, sighing breath. “I thought everything was settled. Sooner or later the body of Paul March would need to be destroyed. There was no immediate hurry. I knew that when the time came, a fire in the old warehouse would cause an explosion in the refrigerating chamber that would probably destroy the body beyond recognition.” He smiled wryly. “When that time came, I didn’t know that the body had been removed.

“I’m afraid,” he said slowly, “I’m afraid I bungled things badly.”

In the long silence that followed, his fingers began stroking Nelle’s hair again, slowly and rhythmically.

“But damn it all,” Helene began. Her voice broke off suddenly, she scowled and began again, “You said you took the letters from Paul March’s pocket. Then how did St. John get them?”
T hold of them? What happened to St. John?” she paused and scowled again. “And Mr. Givvus. None of this explains who murdered Mr. Givvus.”

Henry Gibson Gifford nodded toward the letters Nelle still held limply in her hands.

“They explain who killed Mr. Givvus,” he said quietly. “Who and why. They explain—everything you asked.”
