### Chapter 9
## A Barstool Confession

About an hour later, Nelle phoned her apartment, learned that Henry Gibson Gifford was tucked in bed and sound asleep for the night.

"Curfew won’t ring for hours yet," she reported, coming back to the table. "Let’s think of a place where it would be more fun to do our drinking."

Helene thought of half a dozen with no trouble at all. They moved to one of them.

"Mr. Malone, who shot Paul March?" Nelle asked.

"Can’t you get your mind off that?" Jake groaned, "And nobody ever calls him Mr. Malone."

"Could you get your mind off it?" she asked.

"No," he admitted.

"Tell me how you got to be a radio star," Helene said to change the subject.

Jake groaned again. "That line is out of last night’s show."

Nelle ignored him. "Well, I was educated in a convent in Quebec, where—"

"Not that one," Jake objected, "the one where you were born on an old plantation in Louisiana."

"You mean plantation," Nelle said, pronouncing it just like that. "The Quebec story’s prettier."

"The other is more fun."

"Well," she began again, "one day when I was singing in the choir in Ottumwa, Iowa—"

"How does it feel to skyrocket to fame?" Malone interrupted.

"Don’t use that phrase; I don’t like it," Helene said. "Before you can skyrocket to fame, someone has to set a match to your tail."

For a full five minutes everyone pretended not to know her.

"If I knew where those letters are, I’d feel a lot happier," Nelle said.

Jake sighed. "There she goes again. All right Malone, where are the letters?"

"For that matter," Malone said, loosening his collar and wiping a glistening brow, "where’s the corpse?"

"What good is a murder without a corpse?"
"e?” Helene inquired. “How can you have a corpus if you can’t find the damned thing?”

“Your legal terminology is a little confused,” Malone said severely, “but your intentions are doubtless good.”

“She needs a drink to help her think clearly,” Jake said, and signaled to the waiter.

Malone leaned on the table and stared at Nelle. “Who knew that March was trying to blackmail you?”

“Nobody but Jake.”

“How did March communicate with you?”

“A note,” she said. “I got it at rehearsal yesterday afternoon. It was just a few words on a scrap of paper, written in soft pencil and stuck in an envelope. A Western Union boy brought it.”

“How much did he ask for?”

“Only five hundred dollars,” Nelle said, “but it was too damned much.”

“I don’t know,” Jake said. “Knowing your vivid imagination, I bet those letters are worth a lot more than that.”

“What did you do with the note?” Malone asked.

“I stuck it between the pages of my script, then as soon as I could leave rehearsal, I took it to the little girls’ room, tore it in small pieces, and dropped it down the John.”

“It didn’t occur to you,” Jake said, “you were destroying a piece of evidence that could have sent March to the jug for extortion.”

“I thought I was being wonderfully clever,” she said sadly.

“I suppose it was in his writing?” Malone asked.

“Oh yes. And anyway, he signed his name to it, in full. Yours forever, Paul March.”

“Did anybody handle your script except yourself?”

“Not until I'd destroyed the note.”

“Wait a minute,” Jake said foggily. “Nelle. Your script. Remember? It was lost.”

Her slender eyebrows formed a pair of question marks.

“Lost,” he repeated. “Just before the broadcasts. We never did find out what happened to it.”

She said very slowly and thoughtfully, “Yes, I remember. But Jake, that was after I’d torn up Paul March’s note. I know that.”

Jake said, “Hold up everything for a minute and let me think.”

There was an anxious silence. Several minutes and two drinks later he looked up, his brows knit.

“He’s coming up with something,” Helene murmured hopefully.

He ignored her. “Nelle, you said the note was written in pencil. I’ve been thinking of the kind of paper those scripts are printed on. Do you suppose stuff could come out of them?”

“Out of them maybe,” Nelle said crossly, “but not off them.”

“Damn you, this is serious. Isn’t it just possible that if you stuck that note between the pages of the script, and the note was written in pencil, enough impression of it came off on the script so that someone holding it up to a mirror could read it?”

“That’s a little involved,” Malone said reflectively, “but I see what you mean. A kind of transfer process.” He paused. “But if that were true, then anybody might have known about the blackmail note—anybody who happened to pick up the script.”

“Which means anybody connected with the broadcast,” Jake said. “And if that’s why the script disappeared, it’s a cinch nobody stole it just to get Paul March’s autograph.”

Malone sighed. “Nothing that leads anywhere,” he said. “If somebody killed March to get those letters and blackmail you, there’s nothing to do but sit tight until you hear about it. On the other hand, if somebody killed him to get the letters and protect you, you’ll also be hearing the news soon.”

“If it’s the latter, what do I do?”

“Burn up the letters and keep your mouth shut.”

“But,” Nelle said, turning pale. “Suppose I should be accused of murdering Paul.”

“Don’t worry,” the lawyer said confidently, “I could get you an acquittal on the first ballot.”

“That’s not what I’m thinking about,” Nelle said anxiously. “It’s Tootz. It would be so awful if he knew about this. I don’t care about being arrested, I don’t even care about the program and my reputation. But Tootz mustn’t find out about it, ever, ever, ever. Or Baby. It would be as bad if he found out.”

“Why?” Jake asked. “Why Baby?”

Nelle looked at him crossly. “Can’t you im"
Imagine what Baby might think if he knew I’d had a love affair with Paul, and then was accused of murdering him? Baby is a timid guy anyway.

Jake said, “Hell, I've had enough of this. Let’s go to the Colony Club.”

The sky was faintly gray when they deposited Malone at the Loop Hotel where he had lived for fifteen years and drove Nelle home. Helene turned north along the drive. Jake felt his eyelids suddenly growing unbearably heavy and closed them for an instant. When he opened them again, the familiar scenes of Maple Park were slipping by the car’s windows. He shook and blinked himself awake.

“The only way to enjoy your driving is to sleep through it,” he remarked. “But why are we going out here?”

“I want to change my clothes and pack,” she told him. “Did you forget I’m moving to Erie Street?”

Jake thought a moment. “Are you sure you want to do this?”

“You couldn’t stop me.”

It was noon when they walked into the lobby of the Erie Street building, Helene coolly lovely in a crisp white suit, its perfect severity hinting that it cost more than the average man earned in a week.

Molly Coppins, the landlady, an enormous, slightly faded and very amiable blonde, showing only faint signs of a hangover, was busily sorting papers at the desk. She was delighted to meet Helene Brand.

“Any friend of Mr. Justus is a friend of mine.”

“She gets lonely,” Jake said. “Don’t let her sit around and mope.”

“Don’t worry,” Molly Coppins said, beaming. “Jake, I only have one vacancy that would do for this young lady. Lovely apartment. It’s lucky I have it, too—the occupant just moved out yesterday.”

She found an enormous bunch of keys, led them through the maze of halls and corners, up a flight of stairs, and down a long corridor. She stopped in front of a door marked 215.
