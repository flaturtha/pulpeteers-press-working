YOUR LAST CHANCE...

THE ATTENDANT AT THE TOLLGATE PUNCHED HIS
register, held out a handful of change. “Little colder
tonight”

“Yeah. The driver slid the station wagon away.

The man in the middle seat blinked at stinging
sweat trickling off his eyebrows. He resisted the
impulse to reach for his handkerchief; the watch-
ful teenager at his right might misinterpret the
movement.

That was your last chance, the man told himself
bitterly. You'll never have another. Never in this life.

All he'd have had to do was cry out. Help! Or
Kidnap! That would have done it. The driver might
have made a fast getaway, but the attendant would
have notified the state troopers; the chase would
have been on.

Yet he'd lacked the nerve—just as he'd not been
able to summon up the courage to fling open the
door and dive out onto the highway at that stop light

5

afew miles back. That couple in the other car across
the street would surely have seen him, would have
come to his aid.

But fear of his captors had paralyzed him abso-
lutely; he was the helpless rabbit staring, fascinated,
at the beady eyes of the snake. Knowing what the
end would be, yet powerless to prevent it.

It was not because they had actually threatened
him. What had dropped back there in Buckinghurst—
that had been more effective than any spoken
threat. What had half hypnotized him had been their
matter-of-fact brutality and ruthlessness.

There was also the numbing recognition of the
inference to be drawn from the fact that his abduc-
tors had made not the slightest effort to keep him
from seeing where they were taking him. Evidently
they were not worrying about what he might say,
later.

The headlights funneled down a dark, grove-
guarded slope, flashed past a white barn and a
farmhouse, touched the pale cement of a creek
bridge, bored on through the pine-shadowed gloom
of the next rise.

He knew these Berkshire foothills well; this was
the way he'd driven to the Tanglewood festival only
afew months ago. But he could think of no reason
for them to be bringing him up into these lonely hills
in November.

“If you're going to kill me—" he began, shocked at
the harsh queerness of his voice.

The driver laughed tolerantly. “Don’t be silly. Kill
you? We need you in our business.’

The youth beside him, the teenager with the eyes
Spencer Dean

that looked like peeled grapes, added: “You want to
look at it this way, doc. We're taking you into part-
nership. You could make a sensational score outa
this”

The man felt the muscles of his throat constrict.
Partners with this cold-blooded pair? He knew what
that meant: it was only a question of time before the
partnership would be abruptly ended with bludgeon
or bullet. Yet until that time came there was margin
for hope, even though slim. He would hold onto that
hope as long as he could; he would string it out as
long as possible.

“As businessmen”—he tried to keep the terror out
of his voice— “you know you can't ever sell it.”

The driver chuckled softly. “Try to get your mind
out of the conservative channel, pard. We're thinking
of a radical approach”

“But how can you sell it?” the man asked. “It’s the
only one of its kind in the world. There'll probably
never be another like it. It’s not like a diamond neck-
lace; you can't sell the skins separately. You can't
dispose of it the way you might an old master; it's
only valuable when the public sees it”

“We heard,” the youth with the green-grape eyes
said affably, “it's worth a king's ransom.”

“It is,” the man said bleakly. “There's no way to
put price on it; it's priceless—because it can't be
duplicated, now. Possibly never. But—"

“That's all we want out of it," the driver said over
his shoulder. “That's what you're going to get us.”

The teenager sniggered. “Just a good, average
king's ransom ... and if you play ball nice, we'll cut
you in for a big, fat slice”

The station wagon slowed at the crest of a hill.
The headlights swerved to touch a low building
flanked by two rows of blue cottages, holding in
bright illumination:

CHAPTER 2

JIM HASN'T COME HOME

THETALL MAN WHO CAME THROUGH THE SWINGING
doors from Lexington Avenue had the lean, keen
look of a marine, the prematurely white hair and
mustache of some distinguished diplomat. He had
been a marine; since then he had found himself
exercising what diplomacy he could muster as

Chief of Store Protection for Ambletts Fifth Avenue.
Sometimes, as on this particular day, he wondered
what an ex-leatherneck was doing in a job that
called for lecturing precocious pilferers, questioning
suspected employees, and sending shoplifters to the
House of Correction. But there were compensations;
this evening had been one of them.

The night clerk smiled a greeting, reached toward
the 1709 pigeonhole. “Lady's been calling, Mister
Cadee”

“Business or pleasure, Stan?” Don Cadee quirked
an eyebrow shaggy-white as a chicken feather. “Must
be pleasure, this late” He smiled to conceal a swift
premonition. The only young lady who might call

9
Murder On Delivery

his hotel after midnight would be Sibyl Forde, his
best floor operative and severest critic. Yet scarcely
a quarter hour ago he'd said good-by to Sib at her
Village apartment, after a theater-and-Sardi ses-
sion which certainly hadn't come under the head of
business.

“A Missus Preston, said you know her’ The clerk
fanned out three phone slips, bearing the Time
Received stamp. The first had come in at ten-fifteen.
“She'd like to have you buzz her back, no matter how
late”

“Strictly business.” Bad business, probably, Don
decided on the way to the phone booths. Otherwise
Press himself would have called. Even if there'd been
an accident, Ruth Preston would hardly have called
more than once to let Don know about it. Those
three phone slips ... she must be stewing about
something!

In the three years since Press had been Don's
assistant as Chief of Protection, Ruth had never had
any occasion to be alarmed about her husband. That
was one of the things Don liked about Press: it was
hard to think of an emergency which would cause
the big man more trouble than he could handle. No
screeching shoplifter, caught with the goods, clawing
and biting, had ever rattled him into striking back.
No after-closing prowler, flushed out of his hiding
place and flashing an open switchblade, had ever
panicked old Press. So if there had been any hitch in
that assignment tonight it would be something seri-
ous, or Press would have been able to handle it.

He dialed the Flatbush number marked on the
slips:
Spencer Dean 11

“Hi, Ruth? Don.”

“Oh, Don!” Worry made her voice shrill. “Jim
hasn't come home! Do you know what's happened?”

“No, | don't, Ruth. But don't let it get you ina
swivet.” He spoke soothingly. “He went over to the
Buckinghurst with Mister Grolheim, you know.”

“Yes. He called around six to tell me not to wait
supper. But he said he'd be home around nine...
now it's half-past twelve!”

“They're having a birthday party over there, Ruth.
That kind of celebration might call for corks a-pop-
ping...”

“But you know Jim. He might take a drink or two
... but he'd have called me if he was staying any
length of time, Don.”

“Few glasses of champagne will make anyone
forgetful, He made it sound more reassuring than he
felt “Don't fret about it. I'll check and have him call
you back... or will”

“All right | ... I've been so upset.” She sniffled.
“He's never done this before, all the years we've
been married”

“All the more reason you should forgive him for
one little lapse. Take it easy, Ruth. You'll be hearing
from one or the other of us before long.” He hung up,
went out of the booth, brooded at the row of tele-
phone directories in the rack.

Quickest way would be to ring up the lady's apart-
ment, ask if Press is still there. He thumbed the
Manhattan book to the I's.

Inesco, Inetta, Ineval, Inew, Iney ... no Inez.

He looked under Lily. Dozens of Lilys ... but no
Lily Inez.
Murder On Delivery

Well, hell, that’s her stage name. Nobody'd have
Inez for a last name. Chances are, too, she'll have
a private number, unlisted, to avoid the autograph
pests, the charity cranks. But the apartment building
would know.

He found the number, dialed.

A suave voice, with a faintly British accent, said:
“The Buckinghurst. Whom do you wish?”

“Connect me with Miss Lily Inez?”

“Very sorry, sir. We have no line to that party.”

“This is urgent,” Don said. “l have to get hold of
her in a hurry. Can you give me her number?”

“Very sorry. We are not authorized to give out any
information of that sort” The accent hung up.

Don swore softly. Myron Grolheim had been right.
Ambletts' fur buyer had emphasized the sub rosa
nature of the affair, had insisted that he never had
known who the customer was, had never even been
notified as to the identity of the recipient until a few
days ago. “Whole deal is classified top secret, Don.
Hush-hush and double-shush.” It seemed to be so.

Still, there were other ways to find out what was
delaying Jim Preston's return home ... And no time
to be lost trying them, Don realized.

He caught a cruising cab in front of the hotel.
“Ambletts Fifth Avenue,” he said.

The driver craned his neck. “You must be one
them winda dressers, going to work this time night,
hah?”

“We try to put on a show.” Don answered irritably.

He was annoyed with himself for not having
taken the fur buyer more seriously. He might have
expected Grolheim to be a little jumpy; having the
Spencer Dean 13

responsibility for safe delivery of a hundred-thou-
sand-dollar item might put any store executive on
edge. But the man had been more than apprehen-
sive; he'd really been scared. You saw that, but you
discounted it. You thought he was a worry wart, that
his overactive imagination had brought him to the
point of seeing things at night. But what if Grolheim
had been right about someone trailing him every time
he stepped out of the store?

Don hadn't laughed at him, of course. But neither
had he taken any stock in the mysterious shadower
who hadn't been seen clearly enough for identifica-
tion; what he had done was to agree to convoy the
jumpy buyer and his precious cargo the short dis-
tance from Ambletts to the Buckinghurst. Then there
had been a hitch.

Grolheim had been instructed—by no less an
authority than Bob Stolz, the general manager him-
self—to make delivery precisely at eight-thirty.

Unfortunately that had been curtain time for
Love Life ... for which Don had previously managed
to wangle two in the sixth row center. He hadn't
wanted to disappoint Sibyl, had said as much to
Press, who had been in the Protection office when
Don came back from the fur salon. Old Press had
agreeably taken over what had promised to be a
routine assignment with possibly the added fillip of
seeing the sexiest star on television in the flesh. At
the time, Press had joked about that. Now it didn't
seem much like a kidding matter.

Maybe there would be an explanation at the
store.

The austere gray monolith of Ambletts was
14 Murder On Delivery

silhouetted like an ancient temple against the cold,
star-glittering sky; there were, even at that late hour,
a few window-shopping worshipers at the sidewalk
shrine of fashion.

Don paid the cab driver, walked the forty steps
down the side street to the Employees Entrance,
rang the night bell.

The watchman, who answered, saluted smartly:

“Little tour of inspection, Chief?”

“No inspection, Mike. Just looking for Press. Seen
him?”

“Not since he left with Mister Grolheim. Around
eight-fifteen, that was. | checked ‘em out with that
fancy-wood case”

“Grolheim been back?”

“No, sir. He didn't say anything about coming
back”

“Um.” Don went to the night elevator, waited for
the car to come down with its usual group of chat-
tering cleaning women and glass-polishing porters.
His concern about Press had become suddenly
coupled with an uncomfortable feeling about Myron
Grolheim.

He wasn't as well acquainted with the fur buyer as
with most of the store's top men; Grolheim had only
been with The Store Superlative since Sol Davidson's
death, a matter of a year and a half. But any man
who could make the grade with Ambletts had to be a
good sound man to begin with. Yet there was some-
thing odd about Myron Grolheim, something Don
found it difficult to define. The man was so intense,
so high-strung as to seem almost fanatical at times.

As clearly as if it was just happening, Don could
Spencer Dean

recall the feverish glint in the man’s dark eyes, the
scarcely suppressed excitement in the tense voice:

“You think I'm exaggerating, Don? Well, you really
have to see it to understand. It does something to
you. Come in my office. You'll see what | mean.”

CHAPTER 3

A RUSSIAN CROWN SABLE

THE FUR BUYER'S OFFICE, WITH ITS SOMBER
walnut paneling, the sample table polished to a dark
mirror by countless pelts of seal and fox and beaver,
had appeared gloomy on the few occasions Don

had been there on business. But this afternoon both
office and buyer were transformed.

Grolheim's chronic scowl was replaced by a flush
of anticipation; the room blazed under spotlights
focused on an object which, beneath its denim
shroud, resembled a coffin standing on end.

Grolheim closed the door with the air of a conspir-
ator.”“l had the boys in Display rig these spots so |
could snap a few color shots of Lily Inez”

“So-ho?” Don was astonished. “The busty beauty
makes a personal appearance at Ambletts?”

“I wasn't speaking of the lady herself. Merely the
customary manner of referring to a crown sable
garment by the name of the woman for whom
it was designed. The tradition was already old
when the Empress Eugenie assigned one of her

16
Spencer Dean 17

ladies-in-waiting to do nothing except care for Euge-
nie, the coat”

“Do they smash a bottle of champagne on the
collar when the coat is launched into society?”

“I know ... sounds silly, Don. But it’s all a part
of the regal ceremonials which go with owning the
most exclusive article of wearing apparel in the
whole world. See, up to a century ago no one but
royalty could buy a crown sable. The Czars had a
lock on the pelts; they would only sell to kings and
maharajas and maybe an occasional lucky duke.
Nowadays, of course, you don't have to be listed in
Burke's Peerage to bid for one, but it helps if you're
in the upper brackets of the American Social Regis-
ter, Poors Manual, or Moody's”

Don said: “| see. Sables have a social significance
beyond that of, say, mink?”

“Why, a Russian crown sable is as far superior to
the finest pastel mink—in the social scale of furs,
that is—as a mink is superior to a muskrat! Sables
are for women who are tired of two minks in every
closet. You can’t simulate a sable, it's impossible to
imitate it. That's why it takes patience as well as a fat
purse to get one. It took six months to match out the
skins for this beauty.” Grolheim whisked away the
cloth, disclosing a cabinet of amber-colored wood.
“That was comparatively swift work. All the pelts
have to be brought halfway round the world from
that one small Siberian town of Barzuin. It took more
than a year to assemble the Duchess of Windsor;
even longer to put Barbara Hutton together”

“If you have to rate in the Blue Book to qualify
for one of these items, how did Lily Inez crash the
18 Murder On Delivery

charmed circle, My? | know she’s had a billion-dollar
build-up as Queen of the Kilocycles, but still... “

“You misunderstand, Don. It's the purchaser
who has to rate, not the recipient.” Grolheim fitted
a golden key into a gilded lock. “That's because
nobody can tell what a crown sable coat is going
to cost until after it's been made. That's why you
never see a crown sable advertised; there's no way
to quote a price on it. Oh, maybe once a year some
house, just for the hell of it, will show a little clutch
cape at twenty thousand or so ... but even then
it's Kamchatka fur, not the genuine Yakut. What |
mean is, the furrier has-to know in advance that his
patron is able to come up with a hundred thousand
or more, without squawking, when the garment is
ready for delivery.’

“Who is the patron? ... Or shouldn't | inquire?”
“Doesn't make a bit of difference. | don't know,
myself. Fact, I'm not even sure who does know, Don.”

“Shouldn't be too difficult for some of the keyhole
peepers on the gossip columns to find out which of
the lady’s admirers is able to pick up a six figure tab,”
Don said thoughtfully.

“I expect there'll be some guesses but they won't
be answered at Ambletts. All my instructions were
verbal from the beginning, nothing on paper at all,
nothing. My orders came direct from the general
manager and he made it clear from the start that the
whole deal is classified top secret ... hush-hush and
double-shush.” He opened the door.

The Lily Inez swung out into the spotlight beams;
the magnificent coat hung from a satin-padded
shoulder form fixed to the back of the cabinet’s door.
Spencer Dean 19

Under that bright light the sables seemed alive.
The deep blue pelts quivered with constantly shifting
high lights of rich chestnut; the shimmering of the
silver-tipped guard hairs gave the uncanny effect of
sinuous animal movement.

“You're right, boy.” Don was impressed. “I've
never seen anything like it. It's sensational.

“Glorious, absolutely glorious.” The fur buyer
caressed the shoulder of the garment. “It is more
than probable that this is the finest crown sable
ever made. | can scarcely wait to see if the wearer
is worthy of the coat” He ran the tips of his fingers
down the sleeve. “On the other hand, | can hardly
bear to part with this lovely thing. You can't imagine
what this does to a man who has spent his life with
furs”

Don said to himself: You sound like a guy making
love to a girl. As if you'd like to sleep with that set of
sables. Aloud, he remarked: “| expect you'll be glad
to be rid of the responsibility, boy.”

Grolheim closed the cabinet with the air of one
shutting the door of a mausoleum. “That's quite
true; it is a bit of a sword of Damocles hanging over
my head until | see it safely delivered to the lady.
It’sinsured ... but only in her favor. If anything hap-
pened before she signed the receipt, it would be the
store's loss.”

Don asked: “What you worrying about, My?”

“Nothing, actually,” the buyer said. “Nothing |
can put my finger on, at least.” He switched off the
spotlight. In the late afternoon grayness and with-
out the dazzling sables, the office again seemed
suddenly gloomy; the buyer, too, appeared glum
20 Murder On Delivery

and depressed; the flush of anticipation, the gleam
of excitement were gone. “| suppose you'll think it’s
pure hallucination, but | think I've been followed the
last two or three days.’

Don said: “Here at the store?”

“No. From the time | leave the stored at noon ... at
night. You know that crawly sensation you get some-
times, when you're being watched ... ?”

“You've seen this watcher often enough to recog-
nize him?”

Grolheim replaced the covering cloth. “| know
what you're thinking: The little man who wasn't
there. Hell, it hasn't been one little man ... there
have been two”

“Tell me about ‘em. And don't get the idea I'm
putting you down for a psychopathic case. I'm not,”
Don assured him.

“One is older ... the one who picks me up when
| go out to lunch. Dark, maybe Italian, hard to be
sure, never get a really good look at him, he’s always
ducking into doorways or into a crowd. But I've seen
him at least half a dozen times—he waited outside
the Heidelberg today while | had lunch, he was
across the street near our Employees Entrance when
| came out”

“And the other one?”

“I'm not so sure about him. But he ... he both-
ers me, more than the older one. I've only seen
him once. Last night, as | left to go over to Stel-
lenhachts’—who make up most of our silver fox. |
didn’t see him when | reached the street, though
perhaps he was around—I| was expecting the other
fellow, you understand. But between Broadway and
Spencer Dean 21

Seventh, | stopped and made a bluff to peek in a
store window so | could look behind me. And there,
twenty feet away, was this zoot-suiter—not even
bothering to duck into a doorway or turn his head.”
Grolheim became agitated. “Now | know I'd never
seen that kid before. Yet somehow | felt as if | recog-
nized him. It was almost as if I'd seen him in a dream
and waked up to meet him on the street”

Don nodded. “You'd probably seen him before
when your mind was preoccupied so you didn't pay
any attention to him. Then when you did notice him,
the previous impression came back to you. Did he
follow you the rest of the evening?”

“Only to Stellenhachts, | guess. He couldn't very
well have trailed me away from there; Leo Stellen-
hacht drove me uptown in his limousine. Not that
| didn't look for this youngster on the street when
we came out of the Stellenhacht Building. | did. But
neither of them were around.” Grolheim rubbed his
nose with thumb and forefinger in obvious embar-
rassment. “But | dreamed about the little son of a
bitch last night”

Don grinned. “Go ahead. I'll be your analyst. Pre-
tend you're lying on a couch. Get it off your mind.”

“It's been weighing on my mind, | won't deny
that. | dreamed this kid was strutting down Fifth
Avenue in that crown sable ... and | was trying to
catch him but the crowd kept getting in my way.” He
smiled apprehensively. “Schizophrenia? Or demen-
tia praecox?”

“Neither,” Don said solemnly. “Plain, old-fash-
ioned over strain. Too much concentration on this
big coat deal. We'll make delivery to the lady tonight
22 Murder On Delivery

and then you can go tie one on and forget it”
CHAPTER 4

THE FUR BUYER'S ANXIETY

NOW, THIRTEEN HOURS AFTER THAT
conversation, Don could see things in a different
light. Then it had seemed natural to discount the
buyer's anxiety.

Worry over the coat had weighed on Grolheim’s
mind, left him prey to the delusion of the chronically
apprehensive, that of being followed by some sinis-
ter figure. A casual glimpse of a teenager had been
enough to make the youth seem a skulker on an evil
errand. The subsequent nightmare had merely con-
firmed the fact that Grolheim was overwrought.

Now Don was not so sure. The fur buyer might not
have been dreaming up trouble. Maybe the menace
had really been there all the time, lurking in a dark-
ened doorway. If so, Don had made a bad mistake.

You didn't exactly give him the laugh-off. But nei-
ther did you take much stock in his story about being
trailed. No use to claim, now, that you gave him your
best man to see that shipment across town; maybe
you should have arranged for an armored truck.

23
24

Murder On Delivery

At Grolheim's desk, his hand moved toward the
phone. Then he realized there wouldn't be a night
line connected through the board for a buyer's office.
But he checked, anyway; the instrument was dead.

Except for a heavy crystal ash tray and an
onyx-base clock that said twenty to one, the only
noteworthy item on the desk was a cabinet pho-
tograph framed in Florentine leather. A handsome
boy, about ten, in the dress uniform of some military
school. Stiff-braided collar, bell buttons, full tailcoat,
white trousers creased to a knife edge. Beneath
the visor of the military cap the boy gazed straight
ahead with fierce pride, not unlike the expression in
Grolheim’s eyes when speaking of the crown sable.

In the top drawer of the desk was a jumbled
miscellany of papers. Proofs of Ambletts’ Festival
of Furs ads; memos from comparison shoppers in
Philadelphia and Washington; glossy prints of the
new dolman sleeve designs. Also—tucked under a
clip holding an item from a trade journal about Fox
up at Edmonton—there was a long buff envelope,
one of the twice-a-month missives from the payroll
department.

The envelope was still sealed; the buyer hadn't
bothered to open it. Don slit the envelope. The gray-
green check said that The Store Superlative was
prepared to pay to the order of Myron A. Grolheim
the sum of $741.66 after deductions. It was dated
November 19.

Whatever Grolheim’s worries were, evidently they
couldn't be money worries, if he could leave two
weeks’ pay lying around since day before yesterday
without taking the trouble to deposit it in his bank.
Spencer Dean

Don replaced the check, tucked it under the clip,
tried the side drawers of the desk. They were locked,
as they should have been, according to Standard
Operating Procedure.

Don glanced up at the ceiling: the Display crew
had removed the spotlights. Had Grolheim taken
those color shots? What, exactly, had the buyer
meant to do with the photographs? Other questions,
too, suggested themselves with stroboscopic speed
as he hurried across the fur salon, down to his own
office on the Third.

If the Lily Inez deal was so damn top secret, why
had Grolheim brought Don into it at all? Had that
been the buyer's idea? Or Stolz’s suggestion?

Suppose someone had figured on hijacking a
sable coat worth better than a hundred thousand ...
where could he dispose of the loot? Who would dare
wear it? Could you fly it out of the country to sell it to
some South American dictator? Some oil mogul?

In his own office, Don dug out the Confidential
folder on Grolheim. There wasn't much in it that
helped. Man was a widower with one child. Lived
at 2874 West End Avenue. Had been with Neiman
Marcus in Dallas and later with |. Magnin in Beverly
Hills before joining the staff of The Store Superlative.
There was a phone number. Don dialed it on his out-
side line.

No answer. He kept trying. Nothing but the
burr-burring of the automatic ringer.

Well, hell. Fellow may be in the habit of staying
out till dog's hours. Or could be he’s shacking up with
some lady love. He may be home in half an hour. Lots
of possibilities. Some not so good!

25
Murder On Delivery

He rang the Stolz home. A maid answered sleep-
ily: “No, suh, Mister Stolz not home yet, nor neither
Missus Stolz. No, suh, no idea when he get home.
Who you say speakin’? Mister Cadee? Yes, suh, | tell
him to call you.... At your hotel? Yes, suh.”

Leaves it strictly up to you, boy. You can't stall
around any longer on account of this hush-hush
angle.

He put the Confidential folder back in the file,
switched off the lights, went out to the elevator.

The watchman on Employees’ Entrance unlocked
the street door: “Get hold of Press all right?”

“Not yet, Mike. What kind of car was Mister
Grolheim driving?”

“Ponty. Green and brown station wagon. Fif-
ty-six, I'd say. They couldn't have squeezed that
fancy-wood box in anything except a station wagon,
‘less it was a panel truck”

“No. Sort of clumsy thing to handle” Don touched
the watchman’s arm. “Don't say anything about
Press until | clear it, right?”

“Right, chief. Hope there's nothing wrong with
him...”

“Hope so too.” He knew, now, how Ruth must
have felt for the past three hours. She must have
been sure there was something wrong or she would
have heard from her husband. Don was beginning
to believe she was right. The important thing was to
find out for sure, to find out fast.

A cab dropped him at the Buckinghurst in three
minutes. There was no station wagon in front of the
avenue’s newest cooperative building or on the side
street to the north.
Spencer Dean

The doorman was inside the lobby warming him-
self by the log fire in the great hearth; he intercepted
Don halfway to the night super’s desk.

“Good evening... .You wishto see... ?”

“Miss Lily Inez,” Don said. “Which apartment?”

The doorman passed the buck to the night
superintendent The super looked pained. “Are you
expected, sir?”

“Think | am. I'm from Ambletts.”

“Ah ... ?"The super recovered his poise. He waved
languidly. “The service elevator is closed at ten.”

“That's all right. I'll use the same door as the
white folks. Call your tenant. Tell her Mister Cadee
of Ambletts is on his way up. And get the lead out.
I'm in a rush.” Don pushed the doorman aside firmly,
stepped toward the bank of autotronic cars.

The super huddled with a headphone for a
moment. Then: “She says to come right up, Mister
Cadee. Apartment Seventeen West.”

The doorman leaped into action. “This car. Mister
Cadee. Just press Seventeen.”

The door of 17W was held open by a diminutive
blond maid in a smart, Frenchy uniform. She stared,
puzzled:

“You have not brought it yet? Mamselle's birthday
present? What is the matter!”

“I don’t know,” Don said softly, “but | damn well
mean to find out”

CHAPTER 5

THAT DAMNED COAT

DON HAD SEEN THE STAR ON TELEVISION OFTEN
enough to be an admirer of her brash mannerisms,
her bouncy vitality. He felt she was better than her
publicity men managed to have her pictured, which
was usually in such a way as to emphasize her
ample bosom. Sexy she undoubtedly was, but she
was more than the possessor of the biggest pair in
Albuquerque, as the naughty nightclub lyrics put it.

For him, Lily Inez always managed to make even
the corniest comedy routine seem fresh and funny.
But now, as she came across the big living room to
meet him, he sensed that something had dampened
her customary high spirits. In spite of a dazzling
electric-blue gown cut as low as any censor would
allow, she seemed much older than when he'd last
seen her on the big bulb—older and either tired or
depressed.

Perhaps, he thought, it was because the rose and
gold splendor of the lush décor took away some of
the glamour from her. Or possibly it was because she

28
Spencer Dean

didn't have on all that television make-up. The impu-
dent turned-up nose, the mischievous, overworked
dimples, the wide mouth that seemed to be made
for hearty laughter, the wild mop of apricot-colored
hair that had started the newest fad in coiffures—
they were all strictly as advertised on twenty-five
million sets every Sunday night at nine. But the
bright blue eyes did not have that sparkle which
had been referred to in press releases as like the sun
glinting on wave tops; they were dull, red-rimmed.
She might, he guessed, have been crying.

There was no indication of it in her voice, how-
ever. “You are a bad boy to spoil my birthday party.”
She dimpled at him. “l wanted to show off before
my guests but now they've all gone home—except
Elton.” She waved at the man standing before the
Carrara fireplace. “Elton Hadley, my manager. Mister
... Cadee”

“Evening.” Don bowed.

Hadley was a tall, stout man with a head which
was large even for one of his bulk. He had no visible
eyebrows and a high forehead from which the dark
hair had receded so that his frontal appearance
was oddly like one of those elongated images in an
amusement park's trick mirror. He flipped a hand in
casual greeting; a hand remarkably small in contrast
with his huge limbs—small and pudgy like that of
an over fat baby. “What's holding up the parade,
friend?”

Don said: “Mister Grolheim hasn't been here?”

Lily Inez pouted. “No one from your store has
been here, though delivery was promised positively
by nine at the latest, so | kept delaying dinner and

29
Murder On Delivery

pouring martinis into people until everyone was
practically crocked. You've made me so unhappy...”

You're unhappy, Don said silently. What about
Ruth Preston? “You haven't heard from Mister
Grolheim at all?”

Hadley stroked the lapel of his dinner jacket with
a tiny thumb. “We haven't heard from anybody
connected with your store until you showed up just
now.”

“Your coat left the store at quarter-past eight, Miss
Inez” Don decided that Hadley didn’t look like the
sort of individual who could finance a hundred-thou-
sand-dollar gift. “Two of our most trusted men were
bringing it over. | appreciate your concern about the
sables but | want to know why our employees didn't
get here”

Lily Inez frowned daintily: “Perhaps they misun-
derstood my address ... 7” She glanced at Hadley
doubtfully.

“Don't be silly," the manager said. “How could
you misunderstand an address like the Bucking-
hurst? Mister Cadee thinks these men may have
decamped with your birthday present.”

“No.” Don had the feeling that neither the star nor
her manager was really surprised by the non-arrival
of the sables, that she was following a prearranged
script and that Hadley was improvising as he went
along. “l don't think they ran away with the mer-
chandise. But someone may have intercepted them
before they reached here”

Hadley said: “You're from Ambletts’ investigating
bureau, Mister Cadee?”

“I'm Chief of Store Protection. One of the men
Spencer Dean

who started over here was my assistant, Jim Pres-
ton. The other was the fur buyer, Myron Grolheim.
Nothing can make me believe they would have been
mixed up in anything crooked.” Don thought Lily Inez
was waiting for a cue before saying anything else.
“Only alternative is a hijacking ... a matter for the
cops.”

Lily Inez cried: “Oh no!”

Hadley held up one of the ridiculously small
hands: “Now, just a minute, friend. We can’t have
any police publicity, coat or no coat, see?” He came
toward Don with the false geniality of a politician
about to buttonhole a voter.

Watch your temper, boy. You can't handle these
people the way you'd deal with some coked-up shop-
lifter. This is a kid-glove deal. “Ambletts isn’t anxious
for any publicity, either,” he said. “It’s our policy to
avoid it, to protect our customers from it But if a
crime has been committed, the authorities will have
to be notified. No way out of it.”

Lily Inez put both hands to her cheeks in a stock
gesture of despair. “For God's sake, don’t do any-
thing about it tonight! There may just have been
some stupid mistake ... I'll probably have the coat
by morning. Promise you won't do anything about it
until tomorrow, at least!”

Hadley beamed approval. “Now that’s good
common sense, Lil. You'll admit that, Mister Cadee.
Get the newspaper men in on this now, no telling
what kind of story they'd cook up. One thing sure, it
wouldn't do your store any good. On the face of it,
there must have been carelessness somewhere, if
nothing worse.”

31
Murder On Delivery

Lily Inez clutched Don's arm. “Wait till tomorrow!”

Don said: “l can’t promise that, Miss Inez. | have
a responsibility to my people. I'm not going to go to
sleep and forget about them. But I'll let you know
before | get in touch with the law.”

“Fair enough.” Hadley clapped him on the shoul-
der. “Better all around that way. Even money it’s just
as Lil says, some dumb mishappenstance. Lil will get
in touch with you, first thing in the morning”

“Oh yes,’ she agreed. “And no matter what was
wrong, | won't blame your Mister Preston or Mister
Grolheim. I'm sure it was just one of those things.”

Don found himself being urged toward the door—
Hadley at one elbow, Lily Inez at the other.

The blonde held the door open. “The elevator is
here, sir”

He stepped in, pressed the Lobby button.

They had their story all set, he told himself. They
were expecting someone to throw questions at them
and they had the answers figured in advance. They
know something about that damned coat. But what?

Down in the lobby, the doorman broke off an
argument with the night super about an entry in the
fifth at Hialeah, hurried to open the street door.

On the sidewalk Don paused: “Wouldn't be
anyone on the service elevator this time of night?”

“Oh no, sir. The night man quits at ten.”

“But if a couple of people from Ambletts had
delivered a package here around half-past eight,
they'd have had to use the service car?”

“Yes sir, regulations.”

“When did you come on duty?” Don asked.

“Eight o'clock. | saw your two men deliver that
Spencer Dean 33

package ... only it seemed more like a packing case,
it was so big.”

“That's right. It was quite a bundle” Don tried to
keep his tone matter-of-fact. “Did they take it up to
Miss Inez’ apartment?”

“Well, of course, | couldnt actually say. But they
went in the service entrance and they were gone, oh,
perhaps ten minutes before they came back with the
young man.”

“A third man?”

“Yes, sir. | was busy at the moment, helping
Missus Farley in with her wheel chair, so | didn't
really pay much attention. But there were three of
them and | supposed someone had come down from
Miss Inez’ apartment to help them put the packing
case back in the station wagon—"

“They took it back to the car?”

“Yes. As | say, | wasn't watching, being so busy
with Missus Farley because the slightest jounce
causes her the greatest distress—but | did notice
that even with three of them lifting it was hard work
getting that packing case back into the station
wagon; it must have been pretty heavy”
CHAPTER 6

A HEAVY PACKING CASE

“PRETTY HEAVY, EH? MUST HAVE BEEN, TO NEED THE
three of them to lift it” How much would Grolheim
weigh? Or Press?”You get a good look at these guys?”

“Can't say | did" The doorman considered. “Come
to think of it, believe they all had their backs to me,
while they were putting that packing case back in
the station wagon

“Your man on the service elevator would have
talked to them, though?”

“I suppose. Why? Some difficulty about the deliv-
ery to Miss Inez?”

“Seems so. What's the name of your night man on
the service car?”

“Salvatore. We generally call him Sally. Don't
remember ever having heard his last name. He's a
tough old bird. Dark ... big nose, black-a-da mus-
tache! The watchman smiled at his attempted
dialect.

“Know where he lives?”

“No. But,"the doorman added helpfully, “he’s a

34
Spencer Dean 35

wop. Chances are he lives in some Italian section”

“That narrows it down,” Don said drily. “Wonder
if your superintendent can pinpoint it a little closer”
He went back into the lobby.

From behind the barricade of the desk the super
regarded him warily.

Don said: “This Salvatore on your service car,
what's his last name?”

“How should | know? | don't make out his
checks” The man squinted suspiciously. “What's it to
you, anyway?”

Don scowled. “Someone around here pulled a fast
one tonight when a delivery was being made from
Ambletts. This Sally may have been in on it”

“| don't know what you're talking about,” the
super said defensively. “And | don’t know anything
about Sally, either. You have any complaint, you'll
have to take it up with Mister Wexberger, the man-
ager. He'll be in the office at eight”

“How about getting him on the phone right now?”

“| couldn't possibly do that. If you'll stop around
in the morning ... 7?”

“Look, I'm acting for one of your tenants in this
matter; Don said bleakly. “It was her property that
was sidetracked or hijacked. If you don't want to
cooperate, I'll have Miss Inez put on some pressure.”
He started for the elevator.

The superintendent came running out from
behind his barricade. “You'll have to wait until | see if
it's all right for you to go up again.” He grabbed Don's
arm.

Don clamped a hand on the man's wrist, hauled
him into the car, swung him around, backed him into
36 Murder On Delivery

a corner. “Come along and see, then.” He punched
the Seventeen button.

The doorman rushed over. “Hey, now!”

The elevator door closed; the car began to rise
swiftly.

The superintendent glared. “Who for crysake you
think you are, muscling people around!”

Don made a pushing-away movement with his
palm. “First thing you know, you'll have me believing
you're conniving with this hijack crew.”

“I haven't been out of the goddamn lobby all
night,” the other retorted.“ don’t even know what
was stolen!”

The car slid gently to a stop.

Don crossed to the Seventeen door, thumbed the
buzzer, ignoring the superintendent, who stayed in
the elevator.

The blond maid opened the door, cried “Oooh!
It's not Mister—" She looked horrified, tried to slam
the door. “It’s that store detective!”

Don held the door open easily. “Sorry to barge in
like this, sister, but | haven't any time to waste”

Lily Inez sat cross-legged on the moss-thick
carpet beside a Carrara coffee table, with a highball
glass in her hand. She scrambled to her feet like a
tomboy, disdaining Hadley’s assistance.

“Hello there!” She brought the dimple into instant
play. “l was just saying to Elton how sweet you were
about this ridiculous mix-up.” She smiled, but not
with her eyes.

Don nodded to the manager. “Told you I'd let you
know before | went to the police. I'm going to have to
do it now, unless you can give me some help”
Spencer Dean 37

Hadley answered for her. “Anything we can do,
friend, anything at all”

Lily Inez spoke sharply to the maid. “That will be
all, now, Frances.”

At the door the maid hesitated. “The superinten-
dent... he's out here...”

Don said: “Show him in here; he’s part of the
problem.”

The comedienne murmured doubtfully: “Why, of
course. Ask him to come in, Frances.”

But the superintendent took the cardown ina
hurry.

“He didn’t want to come in,” the maid reported
sullenly.

“He went back downstairs.” She closed the door,
eyed Don disapprovingly as she left the living room.
Don refused a wigwagged offer of a drink from

Hadley.

“No thanks. | don't feel like celebrating. Just
learned from your doorman that Mister Grolheim did
bring your sable to the Buckinghurst around half-
past eight. My assistant was with him.”

“But they didn't come here,’ Lily Inez protested.

Hadley shook his head. “We haven't seen hide nor
hair of ‘em.’

“They were here,” Don repeated. “The two of
them carried the case with the coat in it, to your ser-
vice elevator. Then after ten minutes or so the case
was brought back out to the street. Only this time
there was a third man with them. Possibly a fourth.
They put the case back in Mister Grolheim’s car and
drove away with your coat.” And with something else
that was heavy ... heavy as Ruth Preston's burden of
38 Murder On Delivery

worry, perhaps.

Lily Inez turned to set her highball down on the
coffee table, spoke over her shoulder. “Who—who
were the other men?”

“That's what | want to find out” Don saw a flicker
of irritation cross the manager's face, as if warning
her about something. “The doorman wasn’t watch-
ing closely enough to identify them. But your night
operator on the service car—Salvatore something—
must have seen them, talked to them. So | have to
get hold of him, only that super claims | can’t get
any information until tomorrow morning. I'll have
the cops looking for Ambletts’ men long before then
if | can't find a shortcut on my own.” He spread his
hands. “Maybe you'd prefer to get hold of the Buck-
inghurst manager, dig up the dope on Salvatore,
save me some time.”

Hadley rattled ice cubes in his glass. “No reason
you shouldn’t do that, Lil, no reason at all.” He gazed
moodily at his star. “If that doorman was right, it cer-
tainly does sound like a grab, doesn't it?” He took a
gilded handset from a Neapolitan credenza, plugged
along cord into a baseboard socket, trailed it twenty
feet across the carpet to the cocktail table, handed it
to Lily Inez.

“What shall | say to Wexberger?” she asked queru-
lously.“l don't want to tell him about ... my birthday
present.”

“You don't have to, Don said. “You want Salva-
tore’s name and address and phone number if he
has one. It's not necessary to explain why.” He made
a mental note of the number on the gilded dial she
held.
Spencer Dean 39

“Wexberger'll think I'm schwocked”—she made a
face—"calling at half-past one in the morning.”

“Probably,” Hadley made an attempt at joviality,
“he'll want to come up and join in the revels”

“Probably,” she lifted the receiver, “his wife will
think I'm trying to seduce him ... hello, Jimmy? See
if you can get Mister Wexberger for me ... all right,
Jimmy, it's all right, | know you couldn't keep Mister
Cadee from coming up ... just get Mister Wexberger,
that’s a sweet boy.”

Hadley came over to Don. “Your people will be
covered by insurance on a thing like this, | expect?”

“I'm not in a sweat about the sables,” Don said. “|
want to know what's with our two employees. Some-
times people get hurt in a stick-up”

“That's true,’ Hadley agreed. “But don't you think
you're taking a pretty gloomy view of the whole
thing?”

“I'll be glad to look at it from another angle,
if you'll show it to me.” What the hell is it that
these people knew before | first came in this damn
apartment!

Lily Inez hung up the phone, held out a small
memo pad. “Salvatore Buccini, Seven Twenty-one
East One Hundred and Sixth, the Stromboli. Wex-
berger says he doesn’t have any phone number for
the fellow.”

Don tore the sheet off the pad. “This will do for a
starter, Miss Inez. Much obliged.”

She patted her explosion-effect hairdo in distrac-
tion. “Do you really think my coat is gone for good,
Mister Cadee? I'll be the most disappointed woman
in thisworld... ”
40

Murder On Delivery

He went toward the door. “l haven't had much
experience with the class of thieves who steal crown
sables; | can't guess what they'll do. But I'll let you
know as soon as | know.”

He went down in the autotronic.

The super glared at him. The doorman chided
him: “Jeez, | wouldn't have wised you up to begin
with, if I'd thought you were going to stage a strong-
arm act”

“I'm not the one who staged the strong-arm stuff’
Don was bleak. “That was a couple of other guys.
You may get a chance to identify ‘em in court”

Ten minutes and eighty cents later a cab dropped
him in the heart of Little Italy. Rows of three-story
brownstones with cobblers’ shops, bars, candy
stores, delicatessens, cafés, groceries, fish markets,
pharmacies, a jumble of small commercial estab-
lishments on the ground floors. At 721, which he
had expected to find a rooming house, a neon sign
shimmered violently—a volcano in quivering erup-
tion. Beneath this glowing red and blue display the
twisted tubing said:

CAFE STROMBOLI

He peered through partly curtained windows.
A small bar, a dozen crowded tables, half a dozen
booths, perhaps thirty men. Older men mostly, bald
heads, black mustaches against olive skins. Steve-
dores, truckers, plasterers, men who worked with
their hands. Drinking, smoking, playing cards, laugh-
ing, eating. And all, whatever else they were doing,
talking, jabbering, arguing at the top of their lungs.

Don went in.
Spencer Dean

The torrent of conversation ceased as if someone
had shut it off at a faucet as soon as the door closed
behind him. The air in the place was hot; the odor of
fish and garlic and cheap wine was suffocating.

A score of faces turned toward him inquiringly,
but no one spoke.

“Good evening, gentlemen.” Don moved toward
the bar behind which a very stout man wearing a
stained apron was rinsing wineglasses. “I'm looking
for Salvatore Buccini”

There was a sound as of wind passing through
a grove of pines. A stirring of feet. A couple of the
biggest men laid down their cards and shoved back
their chairs.

The stout man wiped his hands on his apron.
“What was it you wished to see this Buccini about?”
CHAPTER 7

SALVATORE

“IT’S A PERSONAL MATTER THE SMELL OF THE
place reminded Don of dingier cafés he had known
in the war days, only then the customers at the
tables had been much older, or else too feeble even
to wear the Duce’s uniform. Also, in those dens there
had been many women, both young and old. Here
there were only the hard, suspicious faces of the
men, staring at him from the mirror of the back bar.
“Salvatore’s boss at the Buckinghurst said he would
be here”

“He sometimes drops around.” The stout man
polished a wineglass with a dirty towel. “If you wish
to leave your name?”

Salvatore must be here, Don thought; otherwise
the fat boy would have said so, straight off. “Name's
Cadee. Don Cadee." He laid a dollar on the bar.“Un
bicchiere di vino, per favore.”

“Certainly.” Some of the antagonism left the stout
man’s eyes. “You speak the Italian?”

“Un tantino. Enough to find my way around

42
Spencer Dean 43

Napoli. | was there during the war’ The doorman’s
description of Salvatore wouldn't be much help,
Don decided. Most of the faces he could see in the
mirror were swarthy, three out of four were adorned
with large, black mustaches, all seemed to have
large, bony noses. A majority of the men were mid-
dle-aged. “A beautiful city, Napoli. Magnificent bay.”

“The finest in the world, that is true." The stout
man permitted himself a thin smile as he poured the
grappa. “This matter of which you wish to speak. It
has to do with Buccini’s job, perhaps?”

“Yes.” Why had there been such a stir when he had
mentioned Sally? Were his pals expecting someone to
walk in off the street, gunning for the guy? “Salute”
He raised his glass.

“Salute.” The stout man made change. “You like
to leave a message for him?”

“No. | have something to say privately, a warning”

“Ah?”

In the mirror Don could see faces turning, heads
swiveling toward one of the booths in which three
men sat. “He may lose his job if | don't get a chance
to talk to him.”

The youngest of the three in the booth got to his
feet heavily, marched toward the bar with the mus-
cle-bound stride of a man who does much lifting.
“We are all Salvatore’s friends, mister. You can speak
freely to us.’ There was an insolent challenge in his
manner. “You tell us this warning.”

“Fair enough.” Don carried his glass to the booth;
the other two watched him with sullen hostility. “You
are ready to go to bat for your friend; good, fine.
Reason | am here is, I'm going to bat for a couple of
44 Murder On Delivery

mine.”

The younger man caught up with him, put a hand
on his shoulder roughly. “What is this about losing a
job, then?”

“Mind if | sit down?” Don didn't wait for a refusal,
slid into the seat opposite the older of the two in the
booth. The man at his side was surly but showed no
sign of fear. The other, as Don sat down facing him,
was plainly alarmed. “I'll tell you why this Salvatore
is in danger, so he will understand why | am worried
about my friends.”

The younger man kept his hand on Don's shoul-
der until the one at Don's side spoke gruffly: “Si
accomodi, Luigi. We will hear what he has to say.”

Luigi dropped into the empty seat.

Don set his glass down. “l work for a department
store, Ambletts, on Fifth Avenue; so do these two
friends of mine. Earlier tonight they went to the
Buckinghurst to deliver a packing case. They had to
use the service elevator run by your pal Salvatore.
But there was some trouble. A couple of crooks were
waiting for them, probably up on the seventeenth
floor, after they'd gotten out of Salvatore’s car”

The man opposite Don scowled, scratched at his
shoulder.

He's your man, for sure. All you have to do is needle
him enough. “There was a scuffle of some kind up
there; one of my friends got hurt. These hijackers
heaved him into the packing case along with the
stuff they were stealing. Then they made my other
friend go back down in the service car, help them lug
away their loot”

Luigi growled: “You call Salvatore a thief?”
Spencer Dean

Don looked at him gravely. “No. You are not
the kind who would have a thief for a friend.” He
turned to the man beside him. “| believe Salvatore is
honest, just as you do. Chances are he didn't know
just what was going on. My friend who wasn't hurt
wouldn't have been able to say anything about the
steal. So there might not have been any reason for
Salvatore to think there was anything wrong. But he
saw the hijackers; he can describe them. They may
be afraid of that; they might try to fix him so he can't
tell anyone about them.”

The man beside him grunted: “He is in no danger
as long as he keeps his mouth shut”

“Hell he isn't” Don was aware that others in the
booths on either side were listening. “That's one
reason | came to warn him. I'm going to find out
what's happened to my friends, one way or another,
whether Salvatore helps or not. And when I do run
these crooks to earth, they will think it was because
he described them. Then they will try to fix him so he
can't testify against them?”

The man opposite him wiped his face with a blue
bandanna. “You are with the police, no?”

“No. | work for the store. No connection with the
cops.” A couple more jabs with the old needle may
do it, boy. “But if | cant locate my friends in a hurry,
the cops will get in on it. That will make it bad for
anyone who holds back information. Anyone who
does that could get a stretch in the pen.”

Luigi said: “You making threats?”

“Not at all.” Don drained his glass. “Just trying to
help your friend out of a jam. See, there were others
who saw these men; the doorman at the building

45
Murder On Delivery

where Salvatore works, for one. So we'll catch up
with them, only a question of time. But time is
important; | want to catch up with them before any-
thing happens to either of my pals. There's where
Salvatore can help” He lifted the empty glass. “Mi si
secca la lingua... how does it go?”

“... dal parlare?” Luigi chuckled, deep in his
throat. “My throat gets dry, too, listening ... vino!”
He raised his voice.

The other two hastened to empty their glasses
before the stout man arrived with the bottle.

Don took his time about reaching for his wallet.
The man beside him saw the movement, flapped a
callused hand, grunted: “Non costa nulla... ”

No charge, gratis? A good sign. They wouldn't buy
you a drink unless they were buying your argument,
too. But Salvatore might need one more jab.

“If | can get a good description of these hijack-
ers"—he looked around after the glasses had been
filled—"I'll have ‘em in jail in short order. If not, they
will still know they're being hunted. Your friend Sal-
vatore will have to keep looking over his shoulder
for a couple of months. Watching and waiting for
somebody to come out of a dark alley, stick a knife
between his ribs—"

“Diol” the man opposite him burst out. “If | speak,
they say they will get me. If | keep quiet, you say they
will finish me, anyway!”

Luigi put a hand on his sleeve. “Coraggio, Salva-
tore. | think you can trust this Cadee.”

There was a murmur of approval from the adjoin-
ing booths.

Don said: “You are an honest man, Salvatore.
Spencer Dean 47

An honest man is not a coward. Now tell me, you
saw my two friends come in ... the big one with the
shoulders like your Luigi and the red face, the other
shorter and dark and nervous. Which one came back
down in the elevator with you and the other two?”

“The short one with the quick eyes.” Salvatore
drank off his wine hastily. “The big man | did not see
again. | did not know it, if as you say, he was inside
this box. | swear | did not know it”

“No. | expect you didn't” What will you say to Ruth,
now? What can you tell her, except that Press went out
on a job you ducked and may not be back? He kept
the lid on his sudden anger, asked calmly: “What
about the other two?”

Words poured out of Salvatore Buccini like wine
from the bottle. “One was tall, thin, skinny almost,
with a nose that had been broken and a smile like
that of a man telling a dirty joke. Thirty, maybe a
year or so older; his eyes were like those of the little
dogs the rich women in the Buckinghurst carry in
their arms, brown and bulge-out, shiny and nasty.
He did most of the talking; | do not think the boy
spoke at all”

“A boy?” Don was astonished.

“No more than a tween-ager, yes,” Salvatore
babbled wildly. “He was like those who hang in the
poolrooms and rob handbags from old women. Long
black hair plastered close to his head with those
things like Rudolfo Valentino used to wear, long

JIM PRESTON

DON CAME OUT OF THE STROMBOLI TO THE BITING
wind whistling in from the East River, grateful for
that fourth glass of vino which Luigi had insisted

on. But no amount of alcohol would offset the chill
inside him,

There was no longer any margin for doubt; Press
had been hurt, maybe worse. Either there had been
a scuffle up there on the seventeenth floor outside
Lily Inez’ apartment—or else Press had been slugged
out in cold blood. If the curious pair Salvatore had
described were stupid enough to think they could
cash in on a crown sable coat the way they might
have sold a truckload of liquor, then they'd be the
kind who would think they could get away with
murder, too. Maybe by this time Grolheim was in as
bad shape as Press. But that was conjecture; about
Press there was now only the question of how badly
he had been hurt.

Don strode westward, away from the sidewalk
stores, the kids hollering around the oil-drum

49
Murder On Delivery

bonfires, thinking of the times Press had come
through in the clutch. The morning when that
coked-up old biddy had whipped out the hatpin and
stabbed at Don's eyes; Press would carry that scar
to the grave. That afternoon during the Christmas
holidays in jam-packed Aisle Six on the First Floor
when the cornered bag-snatcher had pulled out
an automatic and started blasting at Alice Stern;
the psychiatrists had ruled that the gun-boy was a
maniac who didn’t know what he was doing—but
Press had known what he was doing when he'd
walked into that muzzle. A good man in the clutch,
Jim Preston.

Now someone would have to pinch-hit for him.
It was up to the precinct boys; running down a pair
of stick-up thugs wasn't a job for a store protection
chief. Don had gone as far as he could go without the
cooperation of the force. One or the other of those
hijackers would probably be in the Bureau of Identi-
fication files.

Sally had given them the complete treatment,
once he had started to talk. The old man had a
remarkable memory, too; he had noticed more
details about that duo than most plainclothes men
would have seen if they had watched the pair at a
line-up. Overcoats, hats, shirts, neckties, even the
suede shoes the “tween-ager” had worn—Sally had
been able to recall them all. Including the huge star
sapphire on the tall, skinny one’s right hand ... spot-
ting a ring like that was almost as good as having a
name and address to go on. Someone at headquar-
ters, or in the fur district, or in the circle of Lily Inez’
acquaintances, would be able to put the finger on
Spencer Dean 51

one or the other of those crooks.

All he had to do was take a cab to Centre Street,
speak his piece, let the cops take it from there. But
maybe it wasn't quite that simple. Maybe a little cau-
tion was called for. The hair at the back of his neck
was prickling in that uncomfortable way he'd almost
forgotten, a sensation he hadn't experienced since
those nights on patrol, hunting for prisoners to be
interrogated by Intelligence. How many times, when
there had been no other indication of danger in the
quiet darkness behind enemy lines, had that prick-
ling at the back of his neck suggested instant caution
... and been justified a moment later?

Extrasensory perception, the medical sharps had
called it, not believing init at all ... but he had no
objection to their calling it whatever they liked. It
had never failed him; he was here, alive, and so were
a dozen or so of his company who might not have
come back from those routine patrols if it hadn't
been for that cautionary crawling of his skin.

So now once more he would go slowly, watch
his step. He'd made one mistake, not heeding
Grolheim’s apprehensions: It was clear that the
youth Grolheim had thought was trailing him had
been the one with the plastered-down hair and buck
teeth. Don couldn't risk a second blunder; that pair
had taken Press along with Grolheim, so there was
a possibility both Ambletts men were being held as
hostages. Don't go blundering into it blind a second
time, boy. Don't let the blues in the night mess it up,
either.

A cruising taxi slowed. He waved it to the curb,
gave Sibyl Forde’s Christopher Street address. Sib
52 Murder On Delivery

wouldn't care much for the job he had in mind for
her, but she would do it ... and there was no one else
who could.

He pushed the button over the 4D mailbox in the
lobby of her apartment building, waited, buzzed it
again.

A sleepy drawl came from the perforated brass
talk-back:

“Who is it?”

“Wake you up, sugar?”

“Don! Is this love in bloom or something more
serious?”

“I need some advice”

“Hm. Is that all! How uncomplimentary. Come on
up.”

He went up.

She greeted him satisfactorily, but held him off
at arms length, afterward: “What, for heaven's sake,
have you been drinking?”

“Chianti” He admired the fluffy white lounging
robe which set off her coppery hair and innocent
blue eyes. “Dago red. Not bad, either. Even when
taken professionally.” He kissed one of her more
prominent freckles. “I should have talked to you on
the phone; in pajamas, you distract me”

Sibyl frowned. “You never carry on like this unless
something is really wrong. What's up?”

He told her, beginning with the call from Ruth
Preston, ending with Salvatore’s description of the
two holdup men.

She interrupted only once. “A crown sable coat!
Why, it must be worth a fortune”

“It cost a fortune,” he said, “but what it’s worth to
Spencer Dean 53

a couple of hijackers, | wouldn't be able to guess.”

Sibyl disappeared into the bedroom before he
had finished telling her about the queer reaction
from Lily Inez and her manager.

“Keep right on,” she called through the open door.
“I can hear you while I'm dressing.’

There's my gal! She knows you want her to be with
Ruth Preston if any bad news breaks. You didn't even
have to ask her.

She emerged in a tweed suit that made her look
more like a Junior Leaguer at a hunt club meet than
the best floor operative on Ambletts’ Protection
Staff. “I'll chuck a few things in a bag, only be a
minute. Press lives in Flatbush, doesn’t he?”

He nodded. “Be better if you went right over with-
out calling to let her know you're on the way.”

“Why, natch; she'd say she didn’t want me to
come. But don't you think you ought to let Bob Stolz
know what's happened?”

“I'll ring him again while you're packing” He
dialed the Stolz home. The general manager of
Ambletts answered the phone.

“Bob? Don. We've had a bad break”

“Oh, for God Almighty’s sake! Now what?” Stolz
sounded as if he might have had one martini too
many.

“That little item Grolheim had made up for Lily
Inez—"

“I know about it. Don't tell me—"

“I had Jim Preston go over to the Buckinghurst
with Grolheim, to play it safe. But the coat was
hijacked somewhere inside the building” He gave a
terse account.
54 Murder On Delivery

“You mean they got away with a hundred thou-
sand dollars’ worth of sables?”

“They got away with Grolheim and Press, too.
Seem to have snatched both of them. From what |
can find out, Press was hurt in the scuffle. May have
been killed. | got a pretty good description of the
stick-up pair, to turn over to the police—"

“No! Great Jesus H. Christ, No! We don't want
any publicity about this at all, understand, Don? You
handle it on your own; keep the cops out of it. Hear
what | say?”

“Listen, Bob. There are other people to be consid-
ered— Jim Preston's wife, Grolheim’s family. They
have more at stake than Ambletts” Don was blunt.

“You don't know for sure that there was a kidnap-
ping.” Stolz was less belligerent. “Wait until you have
some more dope before you call in the police”

“Well, hell” Don was surly. “I'll see you in the
morning about it.”

Stolz howled into the phone. “You do what | say,
goddamn it!”

“‘Night, Bob.” Don hung up.

Sibyl said: “I gather that The Store Superlative
is more interested in protecting the reputation of
the television tootsie than in protecting its own
employees?”

“That's right. I'm not sure it’s the smart thing to
ring in the blues just yet, but | don't like to have him
tell me to hold off. And you know something?”

“What?”

“I don't think it's the lady's reputation that’s got
him in a stew, Sib”
CHAPTER 9

A BRUNETTE IN A
TURQUOISE DRESS

SIBYL ADJUSTED A COCKY LITTLE TAM-O'-SHANTER
before her vanity. “What scares Brother Stolz is the
hot breath of scandal. This princely giver must be a
friend of his or the coat wouldn't have been bought
through Ambletts. And, of course, he's a married
man, or there wouldn't be any need of all the hush-
hush. So if the hounds of the law get to sniffin’
around and nose out the name of this big shot, it'll
embarrass our Gee Em horribly with his café-society
chums.”

“He was more than embarrassed, snug; he was
sweating up a head of steam. My guess, there's a
personal angle involved. Maybe Bob's been wench-
ing around with this boy in the background, staging
parties with Lily Inez and some of her cuties on that
Painting the Town show, while Ma Stolz was down in
Nassau.” He took her overnight bag. “However, the
only damned angle that bothers me is the one Ruth

55
56 Murder On Delivery

Preston's worrying about.”

“How much should | tell her?”

“Not too much. Not until we know more. Press
and Grolheim were shanghaied along with the
sables. Maybe they're being held as hostages. If
that’s the ticket, we ought to hear from the hijackers
before long.” He put his arm around her shoulders.
“You'll have to play it by ear, Sib. | don’t know how
she'll take it”

“How do you suppose I'd take it if a couple of kid-
nappers abducted you, darling?” She squeezed his
arm. “Ruth will be frantic.”

“You stick with her till we get something definite.”

“Where do you expect to get it from?”

“I'm going up to Grolheim’s place, first.

“You thought there was something offbeat about
him, didn’t you? That he might have been giving you
a build-up in case something like this happened?”

“I don't know how to put it, Sib.” Don held back
the door of the little self-service elevator to let her
go in. “This afternoon, he was as tensed-up as if
he'd known the hijack was coming. Still, he certainly
didn't strike me as the sort of guy who would con-
nive with the kind of tough lugs Salvatore described.
It was more as if the sight of those crown sables
knocked Grolheim off his rocker”

“That fits,” she said. “The whole business is on
the insane side. Only someone who is a little cracked
could possibly expect to cash in on a coat as conspic-
uous as the Kohinoor..."

“That's what | thought, at first. But they may have
had that figured out in advance... "He didn't elab-
orate, but added: “If | don't get a lead at Grolheim?s,
Spencer Dean 57

I'm going down to headquarters, see if | can make
either of those characters in Cap O’'Berry’s picture
gallery. Here's a cab, hon”

He helped her in.

“Remember what | said, darling.” She touched his
arm lightly. “About how | would feel if anything hap-
pened, to you.”

“Look! Don't you start worrying, Sib”

“| don't like what you've told me about ... these
characters. Be careful, Don”

He waited until the cab had started the long run
to Flatbush, then headed for the subway entrance.

It was ten minutes before an uptown local rolled
into the chilly station; he spent it debating how
much help he might get from headquarters, how
much he would have to tell about the case to get it.

His car was nearly empty, except for two dance-
weary couples up at the other end He propped
himself in a corner, found himself staring absently at
a familiar face on an advertisement opposite:

Laugh—and the World
Laughs with You at
LILY INEZ
Painting the Town
On Channel 19at9 p.m.
This and Every Sunday

He scowled at the merry blue eyes, the saucy
snub nose, the beguiling dimples. You weren't so
amusing tonight. The chuckle meter didn't click off
any new records. You weren't as surprised about what
happened to your crown sables—and to Press and My
58 Murder On Delivery

Grolheim—as you wanted me to think you were, either.

He was sure of that much, but beyond that no
conjecture seemed plausible. She was one of the
very few people who could have known when the
crown sables would be delivered; she could have
tipped off the hijackers. But why should she have?
Does a woman about to receive a practically price-
less gift arrange to have it stolen from right under
her nose?

That big-dome manager, Elton Hadley, might
have been the finger man. Might have done it out of
jealousy or spite, not wanting any other man to rank
higher than he did in his star's favor. If Lily Inez had
known that, or suspected it, she might have acted
as she had, covering up for him. But, in that event,
why had the manager been at the scene of the crime
when he could easily have contrived to be some-
where else? Moreover, why would a professional
man like Hadley, with a considerable reputation
in his own field, put himself in a position where he
could be blackmailed by a couple of kidnappers who
might have to pay the chair price for a snatch?

Neither possibility seemed to make sense. Yet
there was no doubt in Don's mind that the heist had
taken place right outside the star's apartment or
actually inside it, or that both the comedienne and
her manager had learned something about it before
Don had gone upstairs at the Buckinghurst.

He thought about that blond maid as he got off
the train, climbed to Broadway, walked toward West
End. It might be worthwhile to talk to her again.

He had expected Grolheim to have an apartment
in one of the majestic edifices towering fifteen or
Spencer Dean 59

twenty stories and flaunting burnished granite,
weathered bronze, and polished plate glass at the
street level. Like the one halfway up the block there.
But that was 2870; there didn’t seem to be any
other building beyond, other than an ancient brick
warehouse.

The street was empty, though there had been
plenty of activity on Broadway, a short distance
eastward. The only car in sight was a slinky black
limousine with a chauffeur asleep behind the wheel,
a newspaper over his face to keep out the glare of
the street lights.

He didn’t want to wake the man; headed north in
the hope of finding a night watchman at the ware-
house. Had My Grolheim given Ambletts a phony
address?

No ... a dozen paces further he saw the house, one
of the old three-story brownstone fronts set back
twenty feet from the curb line and thus half hidden
to anyone entering its more imposing neighbors. The
2874 showed brassily against the weathered stone.

There was a waist-high iron rail above a sunken
areaway and steps leading down; the entrance was
four steps up. The house was dark. Evidently the
buyer lived here alone; if there had been any elderly
relatives or even a housekeeper, the phone would
have been answered. But he might as well ring, to
make sure.

With his thumb on the pearl button, he paused.
The street door was solid oak, but there were two
long glass insets on either side. Through the right-
hand glass a spark of light showed, danced about
briefly, expired.
60

Murder On Delivery

Someone in there with a flashlight! That was a
reflection along a varnished banister. Nobody who
had legitimate business in there would be using a
hand torch.

He backed off the stoop quickly, went down to the
shadowed areaway.

Shielded by the gloom, he waited for someone to
come out, waited and listened, heard nothing.

Behind him he felt cold metal, iron bars guarding
the glass in the upper half of the basement door. He
gauged the width between the grillwork. It would be
a tight squeeze but he thought it could be done.

He took off his hat, shoved the crown between the
two bars at the right, above the doorknob. A quick
jab with his stiffened forefingers brought a faint
tinkle of glass. Another jab, a brittle crash. He put his
hat on, slid his hand between the bars, squeezed his
wrist through the aperture in the pane as far as he
could, felt around for the key.

It was in the lock, as he had hoped. Most people
did lock their basement doors and leave the key
inside. He turned the key, withdrew his hand, pulled
the door open.

A bakery truck went by at a fast clip, but there
were no pedestrians on the street.

He stepped inside, into pitch darkness, listening.

You're not too well equipped to stage a break-and-
enter job. No jimmy, no flashlight, no gun. Well, hell,
Press hadn't been carrying a gun, either.

His eyes became more accustomed to the dark-
ness. He could make out a storage room, a boiler,
stairs at the back of the basement.

The stairs creaked a little even when he put his
Spencer Dean 61

weight close to the wall. The door at the head of the
stairs was unlocked.

He took a good half minute to open it as noise-
lessly as possible, another full minute standing
stock-still when the door was open.

From somewhere above him there was a dull
bumping; it was repeated a couple of times at quar-
ter-minute intervals. He thought it sounded like
someone closing the drawers of a desk or a bureau.
Means you weren't seen, boy; you haven't been heard,
either, so far.

It was easier to see, there in the first floor. A little
light filtered in under the drawn blinds. Enough to
let him tiptoe through a big, old-fashioned kitchen,
down a long narrow hall to the staircase.

He glanced out through the long glass panel
beside the front door. Nobody on the street.

A door opened somewhere in the second floor but
no light showed. Closet, probably.

He went up quickly; the stairs were carpeted.

From the top of the stairs he could see a slit of
light beneath a door. He decided it was a bedroom at
the back of the house.

Someone was moving around in there, making no
particular effort to be quiet.

He got his hand on the knob of the door, turned it
slowly, opened the door fast.

A girl in a gown sparkling with sequins backed out
of a closet with an armful of clothing on hangers. A
brunette with a figure that was made for the strap-
less turquoise gown. Her shoes were turquoise, too,
the French heels studded with brilliants. She turned
to lay the stuff on Grolheim’s mahogany four-poster,
62 Murder On Delivery

saw him.

“Jesus!” She flung the clothes on the bed. “Jesus
Christ, but you startled me! What the hell are you
doing in this house?”

“You beat me to it” He noticed she was wearing
short white kid gloves. “You took the words right out
of my mouth. That's what | was going to ask you.”
CHAPTER 10

THE“TWEEN-AGER”

SHE RETREATED, STOOD WITH HER BACKTO THE
bureau. “You won't find much worth stealing. My
fiancé’s clothes wouldn't bring more than a few
bucks at a hock shop.”

“Don't know about that; Myron wears the best”
He glanced at the pile of clothing on the bed, at the
shorts and shirts and neckties heaped helter-skelter
in the open Pullman case at her feet “But burglary’s
a bit out of my line. I'm on the other side of the
fence. | work at the store with Myron.”

“Oh—you do!” She sidled toward her mink coat,
draped across the pillows on the bed.

“Must have heard Myron speak of me. I'm Don
Cadee.” He let her see he admired the décolletage,
the way the silver sequins against the turquoise
emphasized the attractive lines of her figure. “And if
you're his fiancée you must be Esther”

“Of course,” she smiled brightly. “l have heard him
mention you, Mister Cadee. But he never suggested
I'd run into you, here, tonight.’

63
64 Murder On Delivery

“My apologies for startling you.” Look at those
sparklers on her fingers, boy! If they're for real, they're
worth as much as this house.

“You don't have to make excuses. Only Myron
didn't tell me anyone else had a key.” She held her
hands out to the disarray, in mock despair. “He
sent me to get some of his things ... to take on our
honeymoon. We had a little smash-up tonight. A
car sideswiped us on the Saw Mill River road; the
window broke and the glass cut him so he had to
have nine stitches taken.”

“Sorry to hear that. But glad he wasn't hurt
seriously” She can't possibly think I'm buying this
boloney. “Where is he now?”

“At my house in Brewster.” She waved at the coats
and trousers. “| wonder if you'd pick out a couple
of suits he could wear in Mexico; | haven't the least
idea which to pack. You see, we weren't going to be
married for a month but when he knew he'd have to
keep this bandage on his face for a couple of weeks,
| talked him into having the ceremony tomorrow and
flying right down to Acapulco”

She must have a gun in the pocket of that mink;
if you fool around with that clothing she'll go for it.
Better call her bluff now. “l don't think he'll need any
of this stuff. He won't be taking that plane in the
morning.”

“No? Why?” She kept her dark eyes on him but
reached out to the mink, her fingers feeling along the
soft fur for the slit of the pocket.

“There'll be detectives at every airport looking
for him, that’s why.” He grabbed the coat, yanked
it off the bed as if to hold it out for her to put on.
Spencer Dean

The black and silver label behind the gold chain
for hanging up the coat was that of Sari Soeurs, a
fashionable Fifty-seventh Street couturier; from the
lining he judged the mink to be almost new.

“You bastard!” She struggled to pull something
out of the pocket. “You lousy bastard!”

“You phony.” He held her wrist tightly.“ never
heard of any Esther. Where'd you get My's key? Who
sent you here to corral his clothes?”

“| did." The voice was soft and elaborately casual;
it was only inches behind his ear.

Don turned slowly, seeing first the polished cor-
dovan puttees, then the flaring uniform pants and
the chauffeur’s jacket, finally the grinning, juvenile
face. Salvatore had pictured this “tween-ager” per-
fectly—the chalk-white complexion, the sideburns,
the insolent eyes beneath the black visor like the
soft, pulpy, gray-green inside of grapes.

“Leggo the doozie’s coat before | shoot off your
thumb.’ The boy held the muzzle of the automatic
high, ready to chop down with it.

“Maxie!” The girl was shrill. “That was too close
for comfort. | thought you were asleep at the
switch!”

The boy pointed the pistol at Don's kidneys. “You
haven't bitch sense, doozie. Handing my name
around like a tip sheet. Now | have to cool this
cookie, because you told him my name?”

“No, no! No, Maxie! Don't!" Terror dilated her
eyes; she clutched involuntarily at his arm. “For
God's sake, none of that!”

Don watched for his chance, but the boy took a
quick step sideways to avoid her; the muzzle never

65
66

Murder On Delivery

moved more than a foot from the small of Don's
back.

“Keep away from me," the boy snarled at her.
“You're so freaking sensitive, you can stick your fin-
gers in your ears.”

He's going to gun you, sure. This is the kid who got
Press, probably. One of these thrill killers. If you don't
want to stand still for being shot down in cold blood,
you'll have to make your play right sudden. “How you
going to cash in on those crown sables when yon
and your partner will be busy ducking a six-state
alert, Junior?”

The boy sniggered. “You're nothing but a crummy
burglar. | saw you bust in that door. They'll give me a
citation for cooling you.”

The girl clutched the coat in her arms, moaning. “|
can't take it, Maxie. Don't do it, for God's sake!” She
thrust an arm toward Don. “Swear you won't say a
word about either of us! Swear you won't go to the
cops! Maxie'll let you live”

Don watched the boy's eyes; they were basilisk,
unwinking. “Don’t believe he'll take advice from you
any better than he will from me, sister”

“Advice?” The youth chuckled. “l can take the stuff
or | can leave it alone. Sure. What | wouldn't take
is your word, not if you swore on a stack of wheat-
cakes. What | trust is a promise from this—" His lips
flattened against his teeth, the gun jumped forward
a couple of inches.

“Max!” The girl screamed. “I'll turn you in, myself!

I will, so help me; I'll holler cop the minute | get
out of here. And if | don't get out you know what'll
happen when—"
Spencer Dean

“Beat it, babe-0."The boy flushed angrily. “Fan
your pants out of here. Go on. I'll bring the clothes
after I've taken care of Whitey, here.”

“I won't, she flared. “l don't trust you. I'm staying
until you go”

A glint of amusement came into the narrowed
greeny eyes. “Okay. Hop downstairs, get me some-
thing to bundle up the baby”

“Use the cords off the Venetians,” she retorted.
“Give me your knife, I'll cut them down.”

“Doozie, now you taught me. Never fuggle around
with a doozie. They'll put you in the corner pocket
every—"

Don lunged as the boy stretched out his left hand
toward her with the switch blade. He struck at the
fingers holding the knife, snatched at the barrel of
the gun, expecting to feel the muzzle blast if not the
final shock. The girl screeched.

The boy wrenched the gun free, rocked back on
his heels, clubbed the barrel like a machinist using a
mallet.

Don tried to roll away from the blow. The front
sight of the automatic caught him above the left ear.
The screeching was drowned out by an explosion
behind his eyes. ...

The roaring subsided, became a faraway ringing.
He tried to put a hand up to the source of the sound.
His muscles didn’t respond. He tried opening his
eyes, could see nothing. The ringing kept on. ...

He didn’t knock your brains out, else your head
wouldn't be aching as if you had a pneumatic hammer
stuck in each ear. The ringing stopped abruptly. That
sound wasn't inside your skull; it was a telephone

67
68 Murder On Delivery

downstairs.

He was cold, shivering cold; realized he must have
been unconscious for some time. He tried to move
his hands again; they were trussed up behind his
back. His ankles were cord-bound, too.

The second time he opened his eyes he twisted
his head a little, saw a faint line of light above him.
Reflection on the window sill from the street lights.
Anyhow, you can see and hear.

He rolled over, feeling a carpet scraping bare skin.
They stripped you, boy. Took your pants, shorts—he
thumped one foot on the carpet—and your shoes. No
wonder you're half frozen. Hell, you're lucky to be half
alive!

It wasn't easy getting up on his knees, for his
muscles were stiff and didn't seem to respond any
too well to orders from his brain. He lost his balance
and fell heavily on the first attempt to rise, banging
his head against the open closet door. But on the
second try he made it and stayed erect, leaning
against the wall. Hobbling slowly and using the
wall for support he made it over to the light switch,
turned his back to it, put on the light.

From the mirror across the room a Halloween
mask leered back at him. A mask crusted with blood,
black with bruises. He went to work on you after he
slugged you out. Maybe that’s what happened to
Press. Maybe Press is still alive, too.

It took five minutes of spine-jolting agony to
hop out to the stairs and down, clinging to the
banister. By the time he'd hobbled to the kitchen
he was drenched with cold sweat. The next move
was simpler. Back up to the kitchen table, pull out
Spencer Dean 69

the drawer, fumble around for a bread knife, jam its
blade between the edge of the table and the closed
drawer, saw the cord at his wrists.

After his ankles were free he put his head under
the tap at the sink, used a dish towel.

In the pantry was an unopened bottle of slivovitz;
he opened it, took it back upstairs with him. After
the third drink the pneumatic hammers made less
racket.

There were none of Grolheim’s clothes in the
closet. They'd carted every last stitch away. Not even
a pair of shorts had been left. The suitcase had been
taken; all the suits on the bed had been removed.
You don’t think you could make it back to your hotel in
a bedspread, do you?

He went back downstairs. There was a hall closet
there, but it, too, had been cleaned out except for a
raincoat. He tried it on; it didn't reach to his knees.

Well, hell ... he could always call the hotel, get
one of the bellhops to bring up or send up a suit and
a pair of shoes. He went to the phone in the living
room. It rang before he picked it up.

“Hello; he said.

“Don! I've been ringing you ever since three
o'clock!”

“What time is it, shugie?”

“It's quarter past four. Are you crocked or some-
thing? You sound so queer!”

“A little cracked tip. But not crocked.”

“Are you all right?” Sibyl was worried.

“I'm in my right mind, even if I'm not fully
clothed”

“Don! What happened?”
70 Murder On Delivery

“Made contact with some of the hijack squad,
shugie”

“So did wel” she exclaimed. “That's why I've been
calling you. | talked to Mister Grolheim ... and he
says everything is going to be all right and Press will
be home in a day or so if we just sit tight and take it
easy.’

He stared incredulously at the instrument in
his hand. “Are you sure you were talking to My
Grolheim?”

“Of course I'm sure. | know his voice. He called me
Sibyl and he was just as reassuring as he could be,
under the circumstances.”

“What circumstances?”

“Well, he couldn't explain exactly. But he did
say things would all be straightened out in a day or
so—including the return of the coat to Lily Inez. And
Press would come back when he did”

“Um—where was he calling from?”

“A bar somewhere. Not in town. He called from a
coin booth. Ruth talked to him, too, for a minute”

“Are you staying there with her?”

“No. She feels better about Press now; she's going
to take a phenobarb, get some sleep.”

“Then you can be a nice St. Bernard dog and
come over here with a keg.”

“You sound stewed!”

“I don't mean a keg of brandy. | have a supply
of slivovitz. But you stop at my hotel and Stan will
have a keg there for you to bring up here. Know the
address? Twenty-eight Seventy-four West End.”

| SUPPOSE YOU'RE
WORRIED ABOUT PRESS

PALE STREAKS OF LIME AND RASPBERRY WERE
showing across the rooftops to the east by the time
Sibyl’s taxi pulled up in front of Grolheim’s house.
The cabman helped her with a heavy suitcase as far
as the steps but then she waved him away, though
she eyed the unlighted entrance doubtfully.

Don opened the front door. “All quiet on the West
End front. I'd help you with the bag, only they might
run me in for indecent exposure.”

“Darling!” Sibyl ignored his bath-towel-and-
blanket costume, winced at his swollen face, now
showing bruises in more colors than the dawn sky.
“Have you had a doctor?”

“All I need is the beautiful nurse” His grin was a
little lopsided, due to the swelling at the left-hand
corner of his mouth where the gunsight had gashed
the skin. “Come in the kitchen; I've made coffee. Ever
try black coffee laced with slivovitz?”

71
72 Murder On Delivery

“Don't be flippant. You frighten me. What hap-
pened to you, for God's sake?”

“Call it careless driving, shug. | forgot that only
a hackie would go to sleep behind the wheel with
a newspaper over his face to keep the light out. A
uniformed chauffeur wouldn't have done that and |
should have noticed it. When | got to horsing around
with a busty brunette, her chauffeur chum came
out from behind his newspaper, put a gun to me,
stripped me stark nekkid.”

“You mean—while she was right here?”

“Oh yes. | have no sense of shame. I'd say if she
hadn't been here then, | wouldn't be here now. The
chauffeur wanted to cool me, as he put it” He poured
coffee for her. “Tell me what Grolheim said.”

Sibyl inspected his battered head. “You must have
a doctor! You might be walking around with a frac-
tured skull”

“It's not as bad as it looks”

“It looks perfectly frightful”

“You should have seen me before | took a
shower.” He set the suitcase on the sink and opened
it, nodding with satisfaction. Stan had followed
instructions pretty well, except he'd put in the brown
shoes. “How come it was you who happened to talk
to Grolheim?”

“I made Ruth take a hot bath, hoping it would
help her get to sleep. While she was in the tub the
phone rang. | recognized Grolheim’s voice, though
probably | wouldn't have if we hadn't just been
talking about him. He asked if he was speaking to
Missus Preston and | said no, it was Miss Forde on
the line. He said ‘Why, hello, Sibyl’and ‘I suppose
Spencer Dean

you're worried about Press’and | told him we cer-
tainly were”

“Was it a local call?”

“No. Long distance. Coin phone; | heard the
quarter drop. Bar or restaurant, there was a juke
box playing while he was talking.” Her eyes showed
alarm when he fished his service pistol out of the
suitcase. “Do you think this chauffeur is coming back
here?”

“Not likely” He stepped into the hall, out of sight,
to put on the shorts Stan had sent. “But it wouldn't
surprise me if | ran into him somewhere; next time
| would rather be on more of an even footing with
him. Go on about Grolheim?”

“He said there was really nothing to worry about;
he'd be back at the store sometime today—or at the
latest by tomorrow—and Press would be with him.
There'd been an attempt to steal the sables but it
had been due to a misunderstanding and he was
helping to straighten it out. In the meantime, no one
should report the temporary detention—that’s what
he called it—of Press and himself to the police or the
FBI or any detective agency. If we just sat tight every-
thing would come out all right”

“Um.” Don put on his shoes. “Did he sound as if he
was talking with a gun in the small of his back?”

“No. He was just as casual as if I'd met him by
accident while | was strolling through the fur salon.”
She sipped at the café royale, wondered about the
stack of canceled checks in the middle of the kitchen
table.” asked him if there was any way we could get
in touch with him and he said that under the circum-
stances he wouldn't give me a phone number to call.
74 Murder On Delivery

But he would give you a ring later on today.’

“Did he explain why Press wasn't calling his own
home instead of getting My to do it?”

“Well, Ruth spoke to him—she came flying out
of the bathroom when she heard me mention
his name—and he told her that Press was being
detained as a sort of hostage for Mister Grolheim’s
good behavior and couldn't come to the phone.
But if no one rang the police or the Department of
Justice boys in on the deal, everything would turn
out all right. So Ruth sent Press a message: ‘We are
sitting tight and taking no action until you are safely
home: She wanted me to be sure and get you to
keep that promise”

“It's too damned unanimous to suit me.” Don
came, back to the kitchen, tucking in his shirt. “Lily
Inez begged me not to call in the cops. Her manager,
Hadley, was sure it would be the wrong thing to do.
Bob Stolz ordered me to stay away from the author-
ities. Now My Grolheim comes up with the same
request. And Ruth joins in the chorus.”

Sibyl was shocked. “You don’t want to do any-
thing that'll hurt Jim Preston's chance of coming
back unharmed”

“No. Of course | don't. You know | don't, Sib.

But | don't think he’s coming back unharmed. My
run-in with the junior member of this hijack team
makes me a little leery on that score. Neither do |
think Grolheim is coming back to Ambletts today or
tomorrow. Come on up to the bedroom.”

“Sir?” She turned her head to look at him out of
the corners of her eyes.

“Want to show you why, shug.” He led her
Spencer Dean

upstairs. “These heisters have a fondness for other
folks’ clothing. When | walked in on this brunette
babe, she was packing Grolheim’s suitcase with
stuff from his bureau and carting his suits out of
the closet there. If they figured on letting him loose
sometime later today, why did they go to all that
trouble!”

Sibyl stared at the heap of bloodstained towels by
the bathroom door. “| can’t think of any reasonable
explanation, darling. But I'll guarantee that Mister
Grolheim thought he was going to come back to the
store this afternoon; aside from sympathizing with
Jim's wife, he sounded as if he didn't have a care in
the world”

“I don't understand it either” Don scooped up the
towels, tossed them in the bathtub. “But there's evi-
dently been quite a transformation in the man since
yesterday afternoon. He was as jumpy as agentina
dentist's chair, waiting for the buzz of the drill”

She touched his swollen mouth with a gentle
finger tip. “I'm pretty jittery myself; suppose that
chauffeur should have come in while we've been up
here”

“It's nearly daylight. Doubt if that lad is anxious to
show his face around here in the daytime. Let's have
one more cup of coffee, then I'll let you pay my cab
fare downtown.”

“They took all your money!”

“Hundred fifty bucks or so. More important, they
took all my master keys for the store. Means we'll
have to have a couple of thousand lockers altered.
Also”"—he patted her arm— “they made off with that
wristwatch you gave me last Christmas.”
Murder On Delivery

“That can be fixed more easily than those
bruises.” She followed him downstairs, peering anx-
iously at dark corners, shadowy doorways. “You're
still confident Mister Grolheim wasn’t behind ... this
whole thing?”

“I'll leave it to you, snug.” He took her to the
kitchen. “These checks were in a locker drawer in his
secretary in the living room: | picked the lock. Look
at these...” He flipped some canceled checks across
the table to her.

She studied them. Fifty dollars to the St Lucretia
Fund for Muscular Dystrophy patients. A hundred
to the Children’s Hospital. Twenty-five to the Asso-
ciation for the Blind. Five hundred to B'nai B'rith
Rehabilitation Program. Six, for eighty-five apiece to
the Mercy Home for the Aged in Lee, Massachusetts.

Don said, “There are a bunch of checks made out
to the Highland Military Academy up in Worcester.
He has a ten-year-old son up there ... or maybe a
nephew. | might be a sucker but | can't believe a man
who'd send his money on those errands would con-
nive with a bunch of crooks.”

“Oh no,” she agreed. “Still—"

“Still you can't understand why Grolheim seemed
so unconcerned about Press. Neither can I. But I'll
tell you something, hon”

“Yes?”

“You and | are not going to sit with our hands in
our laps waiting for My Grolheim and Press to walk in
the Fifth Avenue entrance”

“No?”

“No. We're going to do a bit of researching on our
own. And the first thing we're going to look up is the
Spencer Dean

biggest breakfast on Broadway. That is, if you have
enough money with you.”

CHAPTER 12

AMBLETTS

DON LEANED BACK IN HIS SWIVEL CHAIR AS IF HE
were at the barber's; the steaming hot towel over

his face aided the illusion. He felt the effect of the
beating much more now, at half-past eight, than

he had at four-thirty. His head throbbed, his eyes
ached, his ears rang as if someone were pounding tin
pans at his temples.

Sibyl sloshed another towel in the cut-glass
punch bowl she'd borrowed from Glasswares; it
stood in the center of his desk blotter, full of steam-
ing water. “You think that turquoise gown was an
import?”

“Who can tell the difference,” he mumbled,
“between an import and a copy? All I'm saying is, it
looked like a couple of hundred bucks, maybe more.
It wasn't the sort of dinner dazzle she could have
picked up on Thirty-fourth Street. I'd ask around on
Fifty-Seventh. Her mink had a Sari Soeurs label; if
you can get a list of their mutation customers for the
last year, she ought to be among the elect”

78
Spencer Dean

“It will probably take a subpoena from the dis-
trict attorney's office to make them give up that
list—there'll be a hundred kepties on it, most likely”
She replaced the cold towel with the hot, waving
it expertly to cool it before putting it over his face.
“The dinner gown may be a better chance. Daring
décolletage, splashy with sequins ... someone might
remember who bought a turquoise pretty like that.
I'll give it a whirl”

“One more steaming like this and you'll be able
to serve me with lemon butter and a claw cracker,’
he protested. “Let me cool off a little before Baisha
Gates gets here; she'll think I'm a fugitive from a
Finnish bath.”

“If everything about those crown sables was so
sotto voce, what makes you think she'll know who
styled the coat?”

“From what Grolheim told me there aren't more
than a couple of fur houses that could have had the
pelts on hand. Most of those Seventh Avenue cutters
never handle a sable skin in a lifetime. Miss Gates
will know who could have put the Lily Inez together”
He was not at all sure that anyone at the fur house
would recognize Junior or the older man with the
nasty smile or even the brunette. But one of that
trio might be connected with the firm that made the
coat; he had to check through on it.

“Who'll take my place on the First?” Sibyl asked.

“I'll switch Polly Howarth down there. Problem
is, who'll take Press's place here while you and | are
out of the store? Think Alice Stein can sit in here all
right?”

“Alice can handle anything up to and including a

79
80 Murder On Delivery

judo expert. Sure.” Sibyl took the towel away. “You
do look a bit on the boiled-lobster side, but the
swelling has gone down.’

A glass button on the intercom glowed red. He
touched the Talk toggle. “Yes, Miss Kahn?”

His secretary said: “Miss Gates.”

Don straightened up. “Miss Forde will be out in a
minute, Becky. Then send Miss Gates right in.”

Sibyl picked up the punch bow. “What'll | say to
Ruth if she calls?”

He stared blankly out of the window at the tops
of the Fifth Avenue buses, like clumsy green beetles
crawling through the tangle of traffic. “Tell her we'll
stay away from the boys with the badges—for today
at least”

“Thank the good Lord. | thought you'd be hell-
bent for headquarters as soon as you had seen Bob
Stolz.” She kissed him lightly on the ear, marched
out, carrying the punch bowl like a tournament
trophy.

Baisha Gates came in hesitantly. She was a thin,
spinsterish woman in horn-rim spectacles which
made her look like a harassed schoolteacher. “Oh,
my gracious!” She held up her hands in horror.
“You've been in an accident, Mister Cadee!”

“Sort of” He motioned her to the chair beside his
desk. “But don't waste any sympathy on me; it was
my own fault. Do you know anything about a crown
sable coat that Ambletts sold recently?”

Miss Gates took off her glasses, evidently feeling
that her appearance was improved by their removal.
“As a matter of fact, | do. Though I'm not supposed
to. | learned about it only yesterday. Mister Grolheim
Spencer Dean 81

told me that if anything happened to him, someone
in the department should at least know the bare
details”

“When did he tell you that?”

“Right after lunch yesterday.” She leaned toward
him anxiously. “Has something happened to him,
Mister Cadee? He's invariably at his desk by quarter
past eight unless he’s ill— and then he always tele-
phones me to say he'll be staying home. But | called
his house just before | came to your office and |
couldn't get him.”

“In confidence, Miss Gates, My had to go out of
town unexpectedly. He may be in later today. You
know who made the sable coat?”

“Wolheim Berkowsky, who else? No other house
could touch an order like that. But | must say it's a
queer business, all the way round. The largest single
sale in the history of the store ... and not a line of
publicity about it! Certainly the most fabulous cre-
ation the fur trade in this country has ever known...
and our Fur Salon isn't allowed to share the prestige.
Why, | told Mister Grolheim it’s a sin and a shame; if
we could show that coat for three days it would be
worth a dozen full-page ads in the papers.” She was
indignant.

“| expect Mister Grolheim was ready to agree with
you!”

“No, he wasn't. He"—she hesitated—"seemed
afraid to talk about the whole transaction. At least
he wouldn't tell me who bought it or who it had
been made for”

“He had orders from Mister Stolz not to men-
tion names. But just between us and not to go any
Murder On Delivery

further, the crown sables were for Lily Inez”

She clasped her hands in delight. “How perfectly
marvelous! She will carry a coat like that! It takes a
personage to wear such a garment. Wonderful!”

“I'll have to let you in on another secret, Miss
Gates. The coat was never delivered to the lady. It
was stolen”

She gaped at him. “Stolen,” she whispered. “Oh,
no!”

“Yes. It's just possible that the tip-off to the
thieves came from the Berkowsky end. Do you
happen to know anyone in the firm?”

“Morry Berkowsky. He's vice president, sales man-
ager. We get most of our broadtail from him.”

“See if you can set up an appointment for me to
see him at his place soon as possible, will you?”

“Why, yes, Mister Cadee.” She put a palm to her
cheek, as if she had a toothache. “Do you think
Mister Grolheim could possibly have had a premoni-
tion about the theft? He seemed so ... well, agitated,
| guess you'd say ... yesterday when he spoke to me
about it”

“I think the responsibility was getting him down,
that’s all.” He saw the red eye of the intercom wink
on and off. “Yes, Miss Kahn?”

“Mister Stolz on One, Mister Cadee”’

He flipped the switch, took the phone. “Yes, Bob.”

“Any news on that coat, Don?”

“Some. See you?”

“Come ahead.” Stolz hung up.

Don took Miss Gate's arm. “You won't mention
any of this to anyone outside the Protection Office”

“Oh no. No indeed, Mister Cadee”
Spencer Dean 83

“Let Miss Kahn know as soon as you arrange that
appointment” He had a troubled expression in his
eyes as he watched her leave.

The loudspeaker system was blatting away with
its pre-opening pep talk as he went down the corri-
dor to Stolz’s office:

... Ambletts’ buyers have given you the advantage
of being able to offer to your customers merchandise
which is in many cases obtainable in no other store.
Your attitude should reflect the consciousness of this
superior quality ... and if it does, your sales books will
reflect it also... .

The bland voice from the electrical mouth irri-
tated him more than usual this morning; he was
supposed to think of the store's reputation, too ...
but there was something more important at the
moment.

Stolz took the fat cigar out of his jowly face.
“Christ in the foothills! Who ran you through the
cement mixer?”

“A drape-shape teenager. One of the pair who
shanghaied Press and Grolheim.” He gave a high-
spot report of his visit to the house on West End, of
Sibyl’s conversation with Grolheim. “Comes down
to this, Bob. This crew are playing for time. Time to
cash in on the steal. My guess is that when that time
is up, My Grolheim’s time and Jim Preston's time is
up, too.”

Stolz paced his big office like a panther in a cage.
“Your idea is, Grolheim planned the hijack?”

“No, | don't think so.”

“Well, then, for God's sake—if you don't think he’s
working with these crooks, why don't you believe
84 Murder On Delivery

what he says about our getting back the sables and
about his coming back to the store with Preston?”

Don pointed to his face. “Il have to believe what
| saw up at Grolheim’s house. What that juvenile
maniac did to me. Maybe they've hexed Grolheim
so he believes they're going to let him and Press
go. But | don't think they will. And whether you fire
me here and now or not, I'm not going to sit on my
hands while that bunch of bandits gets ready to bury
a couple of good men. I'm going to keep Ruth Pres-
ton's promise but I'm going after them myself”

Stolz held up a placating palm. “l won't fight you.
And | won't fire you, Don. I'm with you ... but our
hands are tied, boy”

Don smiled wryly. “I've had some experience,
working with my hands tied. For a starter, tell me—
who's paying for that hundred-thousand-dollar
jacket?”
CHAPTER 13

BROKEN RAZOR BLADES

“CAN’TTELL YOU HIS NAME, DON.” AMBLETTS’
general manager doodled fretfully on his desk pad.
“Gave my word not to”

“We can find out the hard way.” Don tried to hide
his irritation; he needed Stolz on his side if he was to
get anywhere on this matter. “But it'll hold us up if
we have to fool with the scandal scavengers on the
newspapers.’

“All you'd accomplish would be to stir up a stink,
which is what we want to avoid.”

“What | want to avoid is sending flowers to Ruth
Preston. You're looking at this in terms of saving
somebody's reputation, Bob. It's a matter of saving a
couple of lives”

“Understand that” Stolz flicked at his intercom
set.“Ann? See if you can put me through to Norm
Rettjer” He eyed Don blandly. “But | don't under-
stand about Myron Grolheim. My experience with
him has been that he’s inclined to look on the dark-
est side of a situation. So if he says this is all going to

85
Murder On Delivery

come out in the wash ... ?”

“He might be right, Bob. | hope he’s right. But
| have to play it on the basis of what happened
up there on West End.’ Is he giving you the tip-off?
Norman K. Rettjer? The celebrated specialist con-
sulted by ailing corporations? The doctor for sickly
dividends? Fellow supposed to be able to sitin on a
different directors’ meeting every day in the month.
That would figure. One of his companies might be
picking up the tab for Painting the Town. He might
have met the lady.

Stolz said: “How are you going to play it?”

“We have some top cards. I've met two of the
hijack crew face to face, | have a good description
of the third man. It shouldn't take too long to iden-
tify one or the other of them. Maybe one of them
worked at Berkowsky's. Lily Inez may know one of
them. We're trying to trace the brunette through
her mink or her gown. I'm going through the files in
the Bureau of Identification; way those guys worked
makes me think they may have been run in, at one
time or another, for jumping.”

“Jumping? Trailing a truck, making off with it
when the driver stops at a gas station or a lunch
wagon? Don't see the connection. ...”

“Same technique, Bob. A jumper never goes after
a loaded truck unless he knows, beforehand, what's
in it and how much it's worth and where it’s going.
The actual snatch only takes a minute—hot-wiring
the motor so it can be started without a key. All the
work is in getting the dope on the load, the driver,
the destination. That's how it was done with the
crown sables, too. They had been trailing Grolheim.
Spencer Dean

They were waiting for him at the destination.’

The voice of the secretary was a mere murmur
from the intercom: “Mister Rettjer is not at his office,
Mister Stolz. His secretary will have him call you back
as soon as he comes in”

“All right, Ann. Stolz might have been sitting
behind a pile of blue chips with a deuce in the hole,
waiting for Don to bet. “Play it cagey, boy. Keep away
from those newspapers. Don't stir up a storm when
the whole thing may blow over with nobody hurt”
He added hasty apology. “Nobody else, | mean”

I'm supposed to take that beating in line of duty
and just forget about it, no hard feelings? Hell you say,
brother! “I'll be out of the store some. Sib Forde will
be, too. Long as Press isn't around, | may ask Alice
Stein to take over on the interviews.”

On his way down from Stolz’s office he was
paged over the public-address system to break up
a disturbance at the Adjustment Bureau, where an
infuriated woman had resorted to flailing a clerk
with an allegedly defective toasting fork from a
barbecue set. He managed to soothe the enraged
customer and to, retrieve the lethal fork before any
real damage had been done ... but it made him more
conscious than ever of Jim Preston's absence. That
was the sort of hassle Press would have handled in
ten minutes; it was a good half-hour before Don got
back to Protection.

Sibyl was waiting for him. “We had a break”

“About time. What?”

“Baisha Gates knows the fur buyer at Sari Soeurs;
she’s certain she can get the list of their recent mink
customers; she’s gone right up there.”

87
Murder On Delivery

“May help.” He riffled through the morning batch
of flyers from the Stores Mutual Protective Associ-
ation. Descriptions of confirmed kleptomaniacs,
amateur shoplifters and confessed boosters, of bag
snatchers and pickpockets who considered crowded
store aisles their happy hunting grounds, of hit-
and-run workers who calmly helped themselves to
garments off the racks and straightaway strolled
out. But no flyers about jumpers or hijackers of sable
coats. ...

Sibyl said: “And Baisha said you have an appoint-
ment with Morris Berkowsky at eleven-thirty, his
office”

“Good. The red button on the intercom winked
on and off and on; the emergency signal. “Yes,
Becky?”

“Miss Stein is in Interview,” his secretary said. “|
think she needs help!”

It was a dozen steps from his desk, through the
outer office; he could hear the screaming before he
flung open the door.

Alice Stein's chunky figure was pinning a young
girl in the corner beyond the heavy table. The
girl's wrists were being held firmly but, between
screeches, she was biting at Alice's neck and butting
her in the face.

Don reached over his operatives shoulder, got a
grip on the girl's hair, held her head back against the
wall.

“Watch her nails!” Alice warned. “She's a slasher.
She ruined a couple hundred dollars’ worth of linge-
rie before they got wise to her. Broken razor blades
under her nails”
Spencer Dean 89

She's a handsome little hellion, Don thought.
Blond and slim and full of fizz and vinegar. Fourteen,
maybe fifteen. That beaver shortie she’s wearing set
some proud parent back quite a stack of coupons.

The girl sneered. “Lingerie! Wait till you find out
what | did to those nylons. And if you want a real
laugh, take a look at those seventy-five-dollar croco-
dile handbags!”

Don spoke over his shoulder. “Miss Kahn. Get the
nurse down here. Tell her to bring sedatives. If the
doctor's in the store, ask him to come along too.”

“| don’t want any damned doctor,” the girl cried.
“You can't make me take any medicine. | won't take
any!”

“You act,” Don said, “as if you've already had
something. You been smoking reefers?”

“Sure” She mocked him gleefully. “I'm hopped
up till 'm ready to pop. But don't ever think I'm not
responsible for my actions. | knew what | was doing
and I'll do it again”

Don let go of the blond hair. “Want everybody
to notice how bad you are, don't you? What's the
matter? You're good-looking enough to get all the
attention you want, without acting like a sulky six-
year-old. Who you trying to get even with?”

“You.” She showed nice even teeth in pure inso-
lence. “You and everybody else in this crummy old
store”

“What's your name?” he asked.

“Jane Doe. And | live in a whorehouse on West
Forty-sixth. Anything else you want to know?”

She began to laugh, rolling her head from side to
side with her eyes closed, the laughter coming in
90 Murder On Delivery

crescendo bursts, louder and louder.

Alice said quietly: “Faking. And she’s no addict,
Don.”

“I know she isn't, Al. Doesn't she have a
handbag?”

“No. May have a wallet in her coat”

The laughter stopped suddenly. “Try and find it,’
the girl panted. “| live on what | make as a street-
walker. | have no visible means of support; you'll
have to arrest me and take me to court”

The nurse bustled in starchily, regarded the girl
amiably.

Don said: “Young lady fancies herself as a mali-
cious bitch. She's been slashing merchandise.
Want to be sure she doesn't slash herself in a fit of
remorse, nurse.”

“Remorse!” the girl screeched hysterically. “Me ...
remorseful? How ridiculous can you be!”

The nurse scolded her. “Behave, now. Sit down.
Over there. Stop putting on an act. We're used to
those shenanigans.”

Alice followed Don to the outer office. “Some-
thing screwy about her, Don. She comes from a good
family ... at least from a family with a good income.
You know what | think? She wants to go to jail... to
hurt someone close to her”

Sibyl peered in at the detainee. “You know, | think
I've seen that kid's picture in the papers recently—or
maybe in a magazine”

Don said: “See if you can find a cleaner’s mark on
her clothes, Al. We'll have to get in touch with her
folks” He hated slashers as much as any store exec-
utive, but Al and the nurse could handle that, time

being.

Becky called: “Mister Stolz on One”

Don took it. “Yes, Bob.”

“Couple of headquarters men on their way up to
see you, boy.” Stolz sounded grave. “| passed the
buck to you because it’s about Myron Grolheim.”

“What about him?”

“Cop on the beat noticed his house had been
broken into. He called a prowl car. The detectives
went in and found a dead man on the kitchen floor”

CHAPTER 14

A DEAD MAN

DON'’S KNUCKLES WHITENED ON THE RECEIVER.
They identify the dead man?”

“Don't believe so." Stolz was worried. “l thought
of Jim Preston right away, of course. But | was afraid
I might cross you up by asking the wrong questions.”

“What did you say?”

“Only that Grolheim hadn't showed up at the
store this morning, no one in the Fur Salon had
heard from him, so you were trying to locate him.
Nothing about the ... coat. Are you going to tell ‘em
you were up there?”

“Depends.” If the dead man was Press, I'll have to
spill the whole story and to hell with secrecy. If it was
My Grolheim, it'll all have to come out, too; the chips
can fall where they may. “I'll call you back, soon as |
can.”He hung up.

Sibyl breathed: “A dead man, Don?”

“Cops saw that broken basement door, went
in, and found a body. If they made any identifica-
tion, they didn't let on to Bob Stolz. Couple of the

92
Spencer Dean

Homicide crew are on their way up here now.”

She put a hand to her throat as if it hurt her to
speak. “Suppose it was ... Press.”

“I have to make sure before | tell them about Max
and the girl, about my having been up there”

“They'll find it out, sooner or later.” Sibyl searched
his eyes. “Our fingerprints will be all over the place”

“If Press is dead, that won't make any difference.
We'll have to get the machinery going to run down
Max and his pals. No sense holding back anything ...
unless Press is still alive”

“But if you stall and later on they learn you were
at Grolheim's—it'll put you in a corner, Don.”

“Both of us ... in the same corner. That's right. You
want to take that gamble? It might have unpleasant
consequences, Sib.”

She was indignant. “You know better than to ask”

“Thought | did.” He smiled tautly.

Becky Kahn announced a Lieutenant Dimmock, a
Sergeant Quinton.

“One minute,” Don told the intercom.

Sibyl said: “Want me to stay?”

“No. Want you to get a line on Mister Norman
Rettjer.

“The tycoon’s tycoon?” She was surprised. “The
princely giver?”

“Shot in the dark. He's a friend of Bob Stolz. You
said the customer would be”

“Yes. Also, he'd have that kind of money to fling
around. And he'd be scared of scandal too”

“See if you can sniff out some. But sub rosa, Sib.’

“Soul of discretion.” She went out.

Through the open office door came a screech of

93
94

Murder On Delivery

fury from the slasher. “You can’t make me take any
of your damn medicine! | won't take it!"

Don shook hands with Dimmock, a chesty mid-
dle-aged detective whose blue serge seemed to be
buttoned around a barrel. He had the suspicious
eyes and the hard, expressionless features of a man
accustomed to constant contact with deception. The
eyes inspected Don's bruised countenance; the lieu-
tenant's face remained impassive.

Quinton, on the other hand, looked like a rangy,
young executive in some prosperous advertising
agency; he was suave and affable in the best Madi-
son Avenue manner.

Dimmock got right down to business. “Your man-
ager says you're anxious to get in touch with this
Mister Grolheim. Expect we're even more concerned
than you are. We want to ask him about a dead man
found in his house this morning.”

Don said: “You sure it wasn't Grolheim you
found?”

Quinton answered. “Gentleman we talked to
downstairs says your fur buyer is a small man, mid-
dle-aged, dark hair, dark complexion. Right?”

“That's right” Don nodded. “What did the dead
man look like?”

“Like he'd been picked on by a pile driver,” Dim-
mock said. “Face beat in. Hell of a mess. Now about
this Grolheim, Mister Stolz said you might have a
photograph.”

Don spoke to the intercom. “Mister Grolheim’s
Confidential folder, please, Miss Kahn.” He turned to
Dimmock. “From what | know of Myron Grolheim, he
wouldn't have the strength or the stamina to beat
Spencer Dean 95

up a schoolboy. How old would you say the victim
was?”

Quinton smiled skeptically. “Be surprised what
a little man can do if he gets mad enough, Mister
Cadee. We had a case, only couple weeks ago. Old
boy in his sixties, wouldn't have weighed more’n a
hundred-twenty in a diving suit, took a hammer to
a moving man come to take back some installment
furniture. Fella looked like he'd been kicked in the
teeth by a mule”

Becky came in with the folder; a shrill scream
from the Interview Room came in with her. The
Homicide men exchanged curious glances.

Don handed the folder across the desk to Dim-
mock. “You'll see by the physical description that
Mister Grolheim wouldn't have been able to put up
much of a battle with a man who was heavier than
he was. Did this dead man have a muscular build?”

“Yeah,” Dimmock said offhandedly. “With this
descrip, we'll have enough to put out a pickup flyer
on Grolheim. You got any dope on his relatives,
friends?”

Don spread his hands. “l have the records of more
than two thousand employees of Ambletts in those
files, Lieutenant. You can see it would be impossi-
ble for us to keep tabs on all of them.” Why are you
holding out on me? Is it because somebody saw me
leaving the West End house with Sib this morning and
you want me to commit myself?

Quinton said: “We don't expect the impossible,
Mister Cadee. But we thought you might be able to
suggest some reason for your fur buyer's absence”

Don said carefully: “l saw him for a few minutes
96 Murder On Delivery

yesterday afternoon. As far as | know, he expected to
be in this morning. His assistant, Miss Gates, looked
for him as usual. His record here has been tops; he's
been in responsible positions with leading stores for
years. Not the sort to run out on his company.”

“Middle-aged men”"—Quinton shook his head
amiably—"do some peculiar things. Glandular dis-
turbances, you know. We had a case—"

Dimmock broke in sharply. “Think you ought to
know that the gentleman has taken all his clothing—
suits, shirts, the works—from his house. Sort of thing
a man does when he’s planning to skip the locality.
Makes it hard for us to entertain any suggestion of
self-defense. Now if he'd stayed put after the battle
he had with this boy, if he'd called the precinct and
asked for a couple of officers to come over—there'd
been a fight and the kid was dead—why, we'd
be able to book him on manslaughter instead of
murder”

“Boy?” Don tried to keep the monosyllable from
disclosing his feelings.

Quinton answered quickly. “Pretty hard to pin
down his age until we get the med-exam’s report,
you know. Fifteen, possibly sixteen. Did Mister
Grolheim have a car?”

“A green and brown Pontiac station wagon, late
model” It was Max, not Press! Max, who nearly beat
you to death. The little bastard who would have killed
you if it hadn't been for the girl in the turquoise dress.
A sense of relief flooded over him.

Dimmock said: “Then Grolheim wouldn't have
been likely to be hiring a chauffeur? This dead kid
had on a chauffeur’s uniform.”
Spencer Dean 97

“I wouldn't know, of course,” Don said cautiously,
“but Mister Grolheim didn’t seem to me like the lim-
ousine type.”

Quinton took the folder from Dimmock, scanned
it swiftly. “Was your fur buyer especially interested in
young boys?”

Don kept his temper. “Only in his son who is in
a military academy, | believe. A very normal guy,
Mister Grolheim, in my opinion. Could this youngster
have been a burglar, perhaps?”

“Sure,” Dimmock said. “He could have been. It
still doesn't explain why a householder who sur-
prised a thief and battered him to death should clear
out without notifying the authorities”

Quinton tucked the folder under his arm. “There'll
be something more to it than burglary, you can bet
on that, Mister Cadee. We'll have the answer within
twenty-four hours, you can bet on that, too”

Dimmock said: “Meantime you'll keep in touch
with us, Mister Cadee? If you hear from your fur
buyer, | mean”

“Sure,” Don said. “Excuse me." The red button on
the intercom glowed on, off, on, off, on again.

“Yes, Miss Kahn.”

“Uh ... call for you on Two," his secretary mur-
mured. “l don't know whether you want to talk to
him, now.”

“Put him on” He knew whose voice he would
hear when he picked up the phone and he wasn't
disappointed.
CHAPTER 15

DEAD OR ALIVE?

DON LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR, JAMMING THE
receiver against his ear. “How you doing, fella?”

“All right, so far,” Grolheim said calmly. “I just
wanted to let you know that the Lily Inez will go back
to town this evening.”

“That's fine, fine” No mistaking the timbre of the
buyer's voice; still, there was something decidedly
queer about Grolheim’s way of talking, Don thought.
It was almost as if the man had dictated to a tape
recording device. But of course that couldn't be,
since Grolheim was replying to the remarks made to
him. “You'll be coming too?”

“Not right away, Don. Not until tomorrow, prob-
ably. Better have Miss Gates get those Fur Festival
proofs out of my top drawer and okay them. They
have to be in today.” The buyer was as matter-of-fact
as if the past fourteen hours had been a blank slate.

“I'll take care of that” Don could see Dimmock’s
head cocked slightly to one side, straining to hear
the other half of the phone conversation. The

928
Spencer Dean

lieutenant was suspicious; it wouldn't be smart to
ask direct questions but there was one query which
had to be put—guardedly. “How's Jim making out,
boy?”

Grolheim’s tone became fainter, as if he had
moved back from the transmitter. “Oh ... | nearly
forgot to tell you—he’s going in with the sables.
Might let his wife know.”

“I'll do that” Don felt perspiration on his fore-
head, knew Dimmock had noticed it, was wondering
why Don was sweating blood. He couldn't gain much
by continuing this restrained double-talk; still he
had the feeling that Grolheim was struggling to get
through with something more coherent than the
casual conversation had provided up to now. “About
what time, should | tell, her?”

“Well... | can't say . ... probably—oh, sometime
after the rehearsal is over” The buyer was plainly
confused. “Eleven or so. Something like that. Well,
see you tomorrow, Don." There was an abrupt click.

Don waited a moment before hanging up. “Take it
easy, boy," he said to the dead line. He couldn't let it
seem as if he'd been cut off cold. “Sorry for the inter-
ruption, gentlemen.”

Quinton was speaking almost before he'd racked
the receiver. “This Grolheim—is he separated from
his wife?”

Don said: “He's a widower; it’s there in the file.
Why?”

The sergeant smiled. “We have reason to believe
there was a woman in the house at the time the
crime was committed.”

Reason? What kind of reason? What had they found

29
100

Murder On Delivery

up there on West End? Traces of face powder? A cop-
pery hair? Had Sibyl left a handkerchief? “Maybe the
woman wasn't with Mister Grolheim. Couldn't she
have been with this youngster who was killed?”

“Yeah,” Lieutenant Dimmock said sourly. “She
could have been the one who pounded him to a
pulp, all we know.” He stared with open hostility.
“You wouldn't be giving us any run-around, trying to
keep your store out of the papers, Mister Cadee? If
you had any news about this Grolheim you wouldn't
hold it back now, would you?”

Don put on a prop scowl of resentment. “If you
have any doubts about the way Ambletts cooperates
with the police, ask your precinct captain; he'll tell
you we play ball. However” —he slapped the blotter
gently with the flat of bis hand—"you can under-
stand that the store wouldn't like to have one of our
executives accused of murder until he’s at least had
a chance to defend himself against the charge. We
back up our people until we find there's good reason
not to, Lieutenant”

“Back ‘em up all you want,” Dimmock growled.
“Just don't buck us.”

“On the contrary,’ Don said, “I'll help all | can. Go
down to the morgue with you right now, see if | can
identify this kid ... ?”

“You couldn't” Quinton waved the offer aside.
“Features were mutilated too much; his own father
wouldn't recognize him. We'll have to work from fin-
gerprints, dental charts, clothing, see?”

Dimmock stalked toward the door. “Where'll we
find this assistant of Grolheim’s?”

“Miss Gates may be out of the store” Don went to
Spencer Dean

the outer office with them. “Miss Kahn, see if you can
get hold of Baisha Gates. These gentlemen want to
talk to her”

Sergeant Quinton shook hands. “We'll have to tell
your switchboard girls to hold up any outside calls
from Mister Grolheim until they can be traced”

“Good idea,” Don said evenly. “l was going to do
that, myself”

Miss Kahn reported that Miss Gates was out of the
store, wasn't expected back until after lunch.

Dimmock grunted. “Leave word we'll be in to see
her” He turned to Don. “Sure there isn’t anything
you'd like to add to what you've told us, before we
send in our report to the Prosecutor's office?”

“What could | add,” Don said, “except that those
of us who knew Mister Grolheim can't believe he'd
be guilty of any crime?”

The lieutenant stalked toward the corridor, spoke
over his shoulder: “We'll drop in again this afternoon
on the chance you may have thought of something”

Becky Kahn waited until they were well out of
hearing: “l hope | did the right thing, putting that call
through... ?”

“Right as rain, Becky.” He patted her shoulder
with more reassurance than he felt. “See if you can
get Mister Stolz for me?”

He decided not to tell Bob about the call from
Grolheim just yet. Time enough for that after the
crown sable had been returned, if it was going to be;
after Jim Preston had shown up, if that was what
Grolheim had meant.

But there was a reservation about that in Don's
mind. The buyer hadn't said Press was all right, only

101
102 Murder On Delivery

that he was coming in with the crown sable coat.
Dead or alive?

Even if the doorman at the Buckinghurst and
Salvatore had been wrong about the disappear-
ance of old Jim, even supposing the implication
of the heaviness of the amber-colored box didn't
mean what Don thought it meant, still—there was
no longer any doubt that both Press and Grolheim
were in the hands of murderers. If they had killed
Max, expecting to lay the crime on Grolheim, they
might just as easily have put Press out of the way,
with the intention of shifting the blame for that onto
Grolheim, too.

The red eye glowed. “Bob? Our friends have gone.
Demised party turns out to be the juvenile delin-
quent who nearly bashed out my brains.”

“Oh? So? Well, relieved to know it wasn’t Jim
Preston.”

“So'm |. Still leaves Grolheim with his tail in a
crack, though!

“How ‘bout you? Do they know you had a run-in
with this kid?”

“No. Maybe | should have told them, but | didn't.
Keeping my fingers crossed for Press.’

“Might get yourself in trouble. Want to be damn
careful”

“I am being. Some fat’s in the fire already. Can't
keep that from spattering onto the front pages. But
I'll do my best to see it doesn't burn any innocent
bystanders.”

“Know you will, Don. Keep me in touch. I'm god-
damn upset about this”

Who isn't? Don retorted silently as he hung up.
Spencer Dean 103

Only person who doesn’t seem to be bothered is My
Grolheim. Have we all misjudged the little man?

He rejected the possibility that the buyer had
been responsible for Max's death. Whatever might be
concealed beneath Grolheim’s gloominess, his ner-
vous apprehensions, his apparent nonchalance on
the telephone, the man was not the homicidal type.

From what he had seen of the girl in the turquoise
dress, she hadn't appeared to be the sort who would
have battered a boy's face so it resembled nothing
human.

Unless there were still other members of the
hijack gang, that left only the man with the nasty
smile Salvatore had described. He'd have been with
Grolheim during that phone call just now. Would,
even before that, have known all he needed to know
from the contents of the wallet Max had taken with
Don's clothes.

“Want to be damn carefull” Not much need of that
warning! Not with a probable murderer in possession
of keys to the store, your office, your hotel room, your
car. ...

Becky drove in on his thoughts. “Miss Stein says
she has to see you right away.”

“Be right out”

Alice Stein stood by his secretary's desk, a hand-
kerchief pressed to her ear. “We'll have to get that
hellcat out of here, Mister Cadee. She's practically
clawed the nurse's eyes out | can't figure what's
eating her but she ought to be in a strait jacket”

“Maybe we'll have to put her there, Al” He went in
the Interview Room.

The girl sat panting in the straight-backed chair;
104 Murder On Delivery

the nurse gripped the girl's crossed wrists behind the
chair back.

“Hal” the prisoner sneered. “Where's your hand-
cuffs, mister? Or did you bring a rope to tie me? Why
don't you have me arrested—why don't you?”

Don said: “We're going to, young lady. But it may
not be quite as big a thrill as you seem to think”

“Go on. Send me to jail" The girl laughed inso-
lently.“l don't mind going to jail. Not so long as they
take me into court afterwards”

That's what she’s after. A chance to cause a sen-
sation in court, probably hoping to disgrace her
parents or maybe to get even with a boy friend. “It
may be quite a while before you get to court,” he said
soberly. “We're not even going to have you charged
with malicious mischief for a while. You're going to
a psychiatric ward for observation; you're as close
to being unbalanced as anyone I've seen for some
time”

The insolence left the girl's eyes; the sneer van-
ished from her lips. “A loony bin?” She cringed. “You
can't put me in a crazy house!” Her voice lost its
shrillness. “You can't!”

The nurse breathed heavily. “That's where you
belong, miss. Wet packs and restraining sheets.”

“No!” The girl bit her upper lip fiercely. “You can't
do that. Not without my parents’ permission. You
can't!”

Don frowned. “We don't know who your parents
are. Ifyouwant totell us... ?”

The girl glared up at him. “No!” she snarled. “No, |
won't tell you! You can do what you want to me but |
won't tell and you can all go to hell!”
CHAPTER 16

THAT MAGNIFICENT
HUSSY

BY TEN, A PLAIN-CLOTHES MAN AND A MATRON
from the precinct had taken the girl to Bellevue;
Alice Stein was listening to the explanations of an
indignant dowager who had been apprehended
while “simply taking the garment out to the street so
she could see how it looked in daylight”; Protection
was settling down to its daily procession of amateur
pilferers and professional boosters. The show did

not divert Don's attention from the curious problem
of My Grolheim’s implausible attitude.

Just now, on the phone, the buyer hadn't seemed
at all concerned about his own precarious situation.
Yet less than twenty-four hours ago he had acted
like a man genuinely alarmed for his own safety. But
yesterday he had been in no actual danger, while
today he must certainly have realized his peril. Had
he been so numbed by the hijacking, the attack on
Press, the death of Max that he could no longer think

105
106 Murder On Delivery

clearly? It seemed improbable.

The intercom announced Miss Forde on One.

“Hello,” he said. “You'll be glad to know the guy
the cops found up on West End wasn't Press.”

“It's a black dog off my back,” Sibyl said. “Who
was he?”

“Teenage torpedo who worked me over. Some-
body had worked on him, with more permanent
results.”

“Police know you were up there, Don?”

“Not yet No. It would have required too much
explanation.”

“Still will. You're only postponing the evil hour”

“If | can postpone it until tomorrow it may turn
the trick. Just had a queer chat with Grolheim on the
phone. He claims everything will be straightened out
by then.”

“By then that coat could be in Rio”

“And Press might be in his—"

“Don't say it!" she cut in sharply. “Speaking of
those crown sables, your shot in the dark may have
hit the mark.”

“Credit our Gee Em for the aiming. What did you
pick up?”

“Geoffrey Ruiz, the syndicated tattler. Just had
coffee schlagober with him at his apartment.”

“Hm. You have to go that far for the information?”

“Don't worry. Geoff's only affair is with his gossip
column. He goes for flattery the way | went for that
whipped cream. He admitted there were whisperings
in so-so-society circles about Miss I. and Mister R”

“Suchas...?”

“Item: when she made that Magnificent Hussy
Spencer Dean

picture in Venice last summer, he just happened to
spend weekends at the Lido. Of course it’s no sin to
be seen sun-bathing together. ...”

“No. So?”

“Item: couple weeks ago she flew to Vegas for
some guest shots at one of those cushy caravanse-
rais—guess who turned up next to her at the roulette
tables every night?”

“He'd be a handy man to have around when the
chips are down.”

“One of his companies buys the commercial spots
on the last half of her show. He's always in the spon-
sors’ booth but never brings his wife”

“Doesn't he have any competition?”

“Nothing else but. Dimpled darling goes out with
more celebrated spenders than the columnists can
keep track of. Cattle barons from the Argentine,
French movie stars, last week one of those ruby-rich
mabharajas. She's never seen with Mister R. in public.
But then, as Geoff points out, the most interesting
téte-a-tétes are seldom in public. And, by the bye, he
owns the Buckinghurst.”

“Convenient for all concerned.” He considered
the possibilities. “Nice, snug job of rounding up the
rumors, chum. Now why don't you go home, catch a
quick nap? You didn't get any sleep to speak of... ”

“Neither did you, unless you count the time you
were unconscious. Anyhow | couldn't rest until |
knew for sure about Press. I'm going to scout around
the exclusive shops to see if | can get a line on that
turquoise gown. And if | do get a lead, where will |
find you?”

“How about the Red Boar, one o'clock?”

107
108 Murder On Delivery

“At the bar," she agreed. “I'll need another pickup
by then.”

He gave Becky the number he'd seen on the
gold receiver at Lily Inez’s apartment. The maid
answered.

“This is Cadee of Ambletts. Let me speak to Miss
Inez”

“She is not here. She is at the rehearsal”

“What studio is that, Frances?”

The maid hesitated. “Twenty Em. But you cannot
call her there. She will not be disturbed. You may
leave a message with me, if you wish.”

“Maybe later, thanks.” He put on his topcoat, told
Becky where he was going, adjusted his hat so the
band didn't press too tightly over the swollen eye.

At the Interview Room he paused only long
enough to wigwag Alice that she was to take over at
his desk. He thought of getting her to caution Baisha
Gates about Dimmock and Quinton but decided
there would be plenty of time for that before the
Homicide men returned.

He walked to the telecasting building, found the
big studio, ran into a uniformed usher at the door.

“No visitors, mister.”

“I have a message for Miss Inez,” Don said.

“Leave it with me. I'll see she gets it. But you can't
comein.”

Don took out a business card, wrote “About Mr.
R”on it, held it out. “How much do you want to bet |
can't come in, if you get that to her right away?”

The usher glanced around to make sure no one
was watching. “You're not one of those lousy process
servers, are you?”
Spencer Dean 109

“She'll tell you I'm not” Don fingered his wallet
“Bet you five she tells you to bring me in."He pulled
the five halfway out of the billfold section.

The usher made a movement as if to push away
the bribe. “l guess you can go in.” He slid his closed
fist into his pocket “Just don't say | let you through.”

Don strolled into the noisy confusion of reflectors,
cameras, lights, microphone booms—picked his
way over snaking cables, through a crowd of shirt-
sleeved technicians, toward a trio of sets at the far
end of the studio. A dozen people clustered around
a long table where a young man in horn rims and a
houndstooth jacket was dealing out pages off a pile
of papers.

“New pages eleven, twelve, kiddies. Turn in your
old pages, get your revisions. Going to run through it
in a minute”

Don spoke to the assistant director at the table.
“Where can | find Miss Inez?”

“You can't” The other continued to hand out
script pages. “Couldn't find her myself. Just tried”

Don put his hand on the assistant director’s
shoulder. “Is Mister Hadley here?”

The horn rims looked up at him owlishly. “Who're
you?”

“Name is Cadee. Mister Hadley knows me.”

“Past that set. Through the little door. Turn left.
Office there”

Don followed directions, filed past a queue
of musicians returning from a break. There were
three men in the office. One hammered at a type-
writer. Another leaned over his shoulder. The third
was Hadley; he sat hunched low in a swivel chair,
110

Murder On Delivery

cradling a phone on his chest, fluttering one of
the childish hands as he talked. His eyes turned
mechanically toward Don; it was a moment before
recognition was complete. Then Hadley set the
phone on its rack.

“For godsake, what happened to you, my friend?”

“Ran into a bit of trouble about that birthday
present.” As far as Don could tell, neither of the
others noticed the interruption. “Want to make sure
Miss Inez doesn't run into the same kind. Have to
talk to her right away.”

Hadley put an arm around Don's shoulders, drew
him out of the office. “Mean to say you were actually
attacked?” He looked as if he was on the verge of a
sheeze.

“By one of the team that hijacked those crown
sables, yes.”

“You—tracked them down?”

“Not exactly. I'm not the only one in on the track-
ing down, either. Police are involved now.”

“No!” Hadley was clearly shocked; he dropped bis
arm.But you promised—"

“I didn't bring them into it,” Don said. “And so
far the cops don't know Miss Inez is mixed up in the
mess. But they're bound to find out. You can't soft-
pedal a murder”

“You ... uh... said murder?” The pink washed out
of Elton Hadley’s face as if a gray shadow had fallen
over the high forehead. “Who ... 7”

“Look,” Don said impatiently, “last night | tried
to get Miss Inez to tell me what she knew about this
crown sable business; she might have prevented a
killing if she hadn't dumbed up. Now I'm not going
Spencer Dean

to horse around with her any longer. Either she talks
to me here and now, or to the police this afternoon.”

Hadley swallowed before he answered. “Friend,
you have her all wrong. Lil wasn't dumbing up. She
was scared to death. That's the fact. She'll tell you
why. Come on. I'll take you to her”
CHAPTER 17

MISERABLE JINGLES AND
COMIC VALENTINES

THE MANAGER STRODE ALONG THE CORRIDOR,
turned a corner, led the way up a short flight, down a
wide hall past a picture-windowed booth with tiered
theater seats like a projection room overlooking

the confusion of apparatus, the churning activity

on the studio floor below. Across the hall from this
observation booth was a narrow door with a red-
lettered warning:

MAINTENANCE—KEEP OUT.

Hadley rapped on it.

“Had to have her dressing room switched up
here,” he started to explain. “Last week we had a
disagreeable—"

The door opened suddenly. Lily Inez, youthful in
white tailored shirt and tight black skirt, gazed in
astonishment. “Why, Mister Cadee! You've been in an
accident!”

Spencer Dean 113

“Nothing accidental, no.” Don took in the scanty
furnishings of the temporary dressing room—
make-up table with mirrors and a clutter of jars, a
chaise, a small coffee table with an electric espresso
machine, some chairs such as undertakers use.“
took a beating, Miss Inez. Trying to find out who
stole your sables.”

“Oh, God!” She registered instant sympathy. “I'm
so frightfully sorry”

“Sorry?” he repeated dourly. “That's hardly
enough’

“Our friend is sore, Lil” Hadley closed the door,
put one foot up on a folding chair, crossed his arms,
and rested them on his knee. “He thinks you held
out on him last night, that if you'd spoken up then
you might have prevented a lulling”

“Ah!” she exclaimed. “Who was killed?”

“Police haven't made an identification yet.” Don
wondered whether her shocked expression was the-
atrical or genuine. “Body's down at the morgue. But |
had a pretty good look at him. Also, Mister Grolheim
described him to me yesterday afternoon.’

She fiddled nervously with a cigarette while he
gave details of his visit to the fur buyer's home, the
encounter with Max. He didn't mention the girl in the
turquoise gown. “Bastard had buck teeth and pale
green eyes and sideburns; his skin was bad and his
talk was tough. Recognize him?”

“No.” She glanced up at Hadley as if for confir-
mation. “Sounds as if he was a perfectly hideous
monster. | don't believe I'd ever be able to forget
anyone so horrible ... if I'd ever seen him.”

“Thing is"—Hadley waggled plump little
114 Murder On Delivery

fingers—“the cops have seen him. They're sure to
find out he was one of those who hijacked the coat;
then they'll want to know why you didn't report the
theft last night. You better set Mister Cadee straight,
or | wouldn't blame him for thinking you know a lot
more about it than you actually do”

“What | think”—Don was impatient—"is that you'd
better realize there's a lot more at stake than any
fancy fur piece. Two of Ambletts’ men are still in the
hands of a gang that doesn't balk at anything in the
book.”

Lily Inez put her hand on Hadley’s sleeve. “Elton
... you'll have to tell them | feel too wretched to run
through the script this morning. | simply could not
make it.”

“I fix" Hadley looked unhappy. “It'll mean over-
time tonight. But you're in no shape to rehearse”

He went to the door. “Don't forget to take your ten-
thirty pill”

“All right.” She rose to lock the door behind him.
“I feel as if I've been rehearsing a nightmare for the
last ten days. I'm closer to a crack-up than an egg
that just rolled off the table” She shook a small
pink tablet from a plastic phial. “A nightmare all
day every day and no sleep at night. | wish to Christ
I'd never heard of the damn sables.” She sat on the
bench before the glittering make-up mirrors.

“Does the gentleman who bought the coat know
how you feel about it?” Don asked.

“Ch yes!” Lily Inez popped the pill into her mouth,
poured a chaser from a thermos jug. “But he’s not
the sort to back down on a promise. And up to last
night he thought the rhymes were the work of some
Spencer Dean 115

former admirer who was jealous of him.” She smiled
wryly at her reflection, tilting her chin up to examine
a throat shadow, reciting meanwhile:

“The day you wear the sable coat
| promise | will cut your throat.”

“Who sent the comic valentine?”

She twisted around on the bench to frown at him.
“I thought at first it was a joke, too, when it came
in the mail ten days ago. But then | began to puzzle
it out—up to then no one but my friend and | knew
anything about this wonderful present ... no one at
all. He hadn't told a soul, nor had |. Not even Elton
.. though he handles all my personal business, my
bank account, my mail, everything. The coat was
to be an absolute secret until my birthday—yester-
day. But it wasn't a secret; the person who wrote
that miserable jingle knew. It worried me; | simply
couldn't imagine anyone who'd make an ugly threat
like that”

Don said: “The generous gentleman had no idea?”

“He knew he couldn't have let the cat out of the
bag so he was sure | must have. | couldn't convince
him otherwise. But of course | was absolutely pos-
itive | hadn't breathed the slightest suggestion to
anyone—so | was certain he must somehow have
let the secret slip. We batted that back and forth the
whole of a distressing evening ... and got nowhere.
| dreamed of stilettos and butcher knives all night
In the morning | was so exhausted | could laugh at
myself. But when | got a call from Elton at the studio
| stopped laughing” She massaged her temples with
116 Murder On Delivery

the tips of her fingers. “The second rhyme had been
sent to me in care of the television network marked
‘Private and Personal. It had been put in with the
batch of fan letters and Elton, who takes the fan mail
seriously, had opened it” She chanted the words in a
depressed tone of voice:

“Once wear the sable that he gave
And then get ready for your grave.”

“Hadley have any suggestion who the rhymester
might be?”

“No indeed. He thought it was some crackpot
because of course he didn't know anything about
the coat. But then | had to tell him. It began to get
him upset, too ... and he has the occupational dis-
ease of the television business, ulcers. It was almost
more of a strain on him than on me, with those nasty
couplets coming in every day like clockwork.

“But don that garment once and |
Will guarantee that you will die”

“Were these things handwritten?”

She reached for an ostrich leather bag on the
chaise, opened it, took out a check wallet, from
beneath the pad of checks removed a folded sheet.
“This is the last one; day before yesterday.”

It was neatly typed in the center of a sheet of
coarse white paper, letterhead size:

Let your conscience be your guide
And be not the coffin’s bride.
Spencer Dean 117

He fingered the paper thoughtfully. “You haven't
made any attempt to trace this?”

“How could we? There are good reasons why my
friend does not want any publicity and just as many
why it should hurt me professionally.” She gestured
at the paper. “It's written on studio paper—it's made
especially so it won't make crackling noises when
you rustle it near a mike. But almost anyone could
get hold of a few sheets like that”

“What about the envelopes?”

“They're at home. | kept them all. Plain, dime-
store variety” She held out her hand for the jingle. ”l
know you're supposed to be able to trace a thing like
this from the typewriting. He wanted to get a firm
of private detectives on it but | wouldn't let him; the
whole thing has made me so desperately miserable.
All my life I've been fighting for something | never
thought I'd have, absolute security. Maybe you don't
know it but there aren't too many in show business
who do get it. A big salary, yes—but you have to cut
it up six ways from Sunday and few of us put enough
away to feel safe, no matter if the options aren't
picked up. There's always that fear of being old and
sick and alone in some cheap rooming house.” Her
eyes closed. “I really thought | had it made this time.
| even thought | might get that jackpot bonus along
with it, genuine happiness with someone | honestly
care for. But | guess it's not in the cards for me. | told
him last night that if it hadn't been for the possibility
your store people might have been hurt, I'd be glad
the damn coat had been stolen. | meant it”

“It's to be returned tonight, Miss Inez”
She gasped. “To me?”
118 Murder On Delivery

“I suppose. Mister Grolheim phoned to say it
would be brought back sometime late this evening”

“But—then why did they steal it?”

“For money. Only thing that sort of thug steals
for”

“Who would pay them?”

“Your Mister Rettjer”

“No!” She came to her feet. “He'd never do a thing
like that!”

“Somebody's going to pay, if the crown sables
come back. It doesn’t seem as if you'd be interested
in putting up the money. Who besides Mister Rettjer
would you suggest?”

She sat down suddenly as if she was faint. “He
doesn’t know about the murder. It would almost
make him a party to the crime, wouldn't it?”

“Compounding a felony, it’s called. Yes. | don't
care about that. I'm not a cop. But if Mister Rettjer
has made a deal with these hijackers, he'll have
made arrangements to get the money to them
before the coat is turned over. | want to know what
those arrangements are and | want to know in a
hurry. You better get hold of your friend and find

RETTJER

THE STAR OF PAINTING THE TOWN RAN A DIAMOND-
studded silver comb through the famous tousled
hair. “How did you find out about Norman?”

“There's been talk about his being in Las Vegas
while you were there”

She made a comical moue.“l told him it was a
mistake for him to go out there.”

“It'll be your mistake if you don’t call him now.’

“There's a phone booth up on the next floor”

“Think of all the raised eyebrows if | were to be
seen crowding into a public booth with you. And |
have to hear what you say to him.”

“I'm sure you wouldn't crowd me, Mister Cadee.”

“I might have to,” he said soberly. “There's a
phone in that sponsor's booth across the hall.”

“He doesn’t like me to call him at the office”

“I won't like it if you don't. Tell him | have to see
him right away.’

She laid the comb down reluctantly. “| hate to
do anything that might get him in trouble, Mister

119
120 Murder On Delivery

Cadee’

“He's in trouble up to his ears already if he's made
a deal with these hijackers. You and | may be able to
keep him from getting in deeper”

“Then I'll try to get him to see you”

The phone was on a low table in front of the first
row of seats in the steeply tiered booth. The only
light in the darkened cubicle came from the great
glass window looking down on the bustling activity
of the studio. Electricians trailed coils of cable to
and fro, sport-shirted cameramen made mysterious
adjustments with their cumbersome apparatus,
musicians penciled notations on score sheets, a
quartet of dancers in ballet costume burlesqued a
number from the Firebird.

Lily Inez sat down a yard from the glass partition,
dialed. “Mister Norman Rettjer, please... . Tell him
Miss Smolyanka would like to speak to him" She
smiled impishly at Don. “With a name like that you
wonder | want to change it?... Oh, God!" The smile
vanished. “Look!” She huddled down in her seat,
pointing.

Down by the backdrop of the middle set with its
row of Lautrec-like cancan dancers high-kicking at
crimson balloons and pink champagne bottles spell-
ing out P-A-I-N-T-I-N-G T-H-E T-O-W-N, he saw Elton
Hadley in agitated conversation with a handsome
woman in a heather tweed—a woman in her early
thirties with a haughty manner, cold, patrician fea-
tures, and dark glasses hiding her eyes.

“Helen Rettjer! Norman's wife.” Lily Inez held her
hand over the mouthpiece. “I've never seen her at
the studio before. She mustn't see me!”
Spencer Dean 121

Don stepped between her and the glass partition.
“Go ahead on your call” He thought the imperious
lady was telling off Hadley in spades; the manager's
huge head was bobbing, his childlike hands were
held out in anxious appeal.

“Norman?”The timbre of Lily Inez’ voice became
noticeably more husky. “That man from Ambletts is
here in the studio with me ... yes, yes, | know—but
it’s absolutely important | tell you now, right this
minute...”

Don observed Hadley beckoning to the assistant
director in the houndstooth jacket. The latter hurried
over, listened to the voluble lady in the dark glasses;
then, he, too, began to shrug and shake his head in
obvious denial.

“Mister Cadee,’ Lily Inez said, “tells me your pres-
ent is to delivered some time tonight ... Do you know
about that? ... Yes? ... Then he has to see you imme-
diately before you complete the arrangements.”

On the floor below, Missus Rettjer held up a
gloved hand, spoke briefly and bitterly, swung on
her heel, and stalked away disdainfully.

“I realize you have other matters which are
important, Norman, but this is a matter of life and
death, | mean it... . Yes—and by the way—Helen
is here in the studio, now. Do you know what she
wants?”

Hadley exchanged earnest words with the assis-
tant directer before he loped after Missus Rettjer,
caught up with her, began an expostulation which
stopped the lady in her tracks.

“No, | haven't spoken to her ... | don't intend
to, no. What? ... All right, I'll tell him. ... Ch, I'm so
122 Murder On Delivery

utterly wretched I'm going straight back to the apart-
ment ... Yes, call me there” She hung up. “Is she still
here?”

Don moved aside. “The coast is clear. Your man-
ager just left with her. Does her husband know
what's on her mind?”

“Not at all. He's flabbergasted. He thought she
was on her way to Nassau by plane.” She clapped a
hand to her forehead. “She must have come here to
make a scene. That's all | need, a scene with her. Oh,
God!”

“I was right about the coat?” he asked.

“Yes, you were. Though he doesn't believe there's
anything to be worried about. He says he talked to
one of the men from your store only a little while ago
and there isn't going to be any trouble at all about
getting the coat back”

All a misunderstanding—wasn’t that what
Grolheim had told Sib last night? “When will he see
me?”

“As soon as you can get down to his office. Do
you know where it is? Forty Wall. Intekcom Holding
Corporation.”

“I'll find it.” Don took her arm. “How much does
Mister Rettjer’s wife know about you?”

“Nothing ... except what she may have heard in
the way of rumors from Las Vegas and so on. She
knows he doesn't care for her; they've been all but
legally separated for a year. But she won't give him
a divorce and he won't try to get one. | suppose she
may suspect there's another woman—or more than
one, for that matter. But I'm sure she has no idea
that Norm would marry me tomorrow if he were
Spencer Dean 123

free”

“She has ideas about something; she was giving
your manager a bad five minutes there”

Lily Inez sighed. “This is the day I've been dread-
ing. Helen wouldn't have come here unless she'd
meant to have a showdown.” She followed him up
the tier of steps. “It makes me think she must have
sent me those horrid rhymes. Maybe she arranged
to have the coat stolen—though how she could have
found out about that ... "Her voice trailed away.

Don thought she was fighting to keep back a
flood of tears. “You're not going to rehearse this
afternoon?”

“No.

“I may drop around to the apartment later then.’
He went down the short flight, out to the studio
floor. Neither Hadley nor Helen Rettjer was in sight,
nor did he see either of them in the lobby of Telecast
Towers as be left the building.

The offices of Intekcom were as quiet and sub-
dued as the studio had been noisy and confused.
The receptionist was an elderly man who looked like
a professor.

“Mister Rettjer is expecting you, Mister Cadee.
This way, if you please”

The financier’s office was homey rather than
impressive. No desk—merely a large table spread
with charts. Easy chairs, and logs glowing in a cheer-
ful brick fireplace. A small bar, a giant television set
... and the man himself, a small-boned man with a
rock-hard face, smoking a pipe and scrutinizing his
visitor through rimless spectacles before offering to
shake hands.
124 Murder On Delivery

“I can understand your store's position in this
matter, Mister Cadee””

“Then we won't waste time on that.” Don refused
a cigar. “I'm here because of my personal interest
in two of our men. Not because of the crown sable
coat.

Rettjer rubbed the bowl of the briar against the
side of his nose. “I'm glad to be able to set your mind
at ease on that score. | had a very pleasant conver-
sation with your Mister Grolheim; he anticipates no
further difficulties in the transaction.”

“What about the other man? Jim Preston?”

“Your fur buyer didn't mention him, Mister
Cadee’

“Then you don't know whether he’s still alive?”

The financier smiled tolerantly. “Nothing Mister
Grolheim said indicated any unpleasantness, so |
assume both your men are quite all right and will be
back on the job tomorrow.”

“I don't assume that,” Don said bluntly. “And as
for unpleasantness, there's been plenty. | was put
through a rock crusher by one of the hijackers last
night”

Rettjer showed no emotion. “l knew nothing of
that”

“Evidently there are other things you don't know.
| have damn good reason to believe Jim Preston was
slugged unconscious, probably killed, outside Miss
Inez’ apartment last night when the sables were
stolen.”

“She told me you were afraid he had been hurt.

“I'm afraid he's dead. As dead as the member of
the gang the police found in Grolheim’s house this
Spencer Dean 125

morning.”

Rettjer knocked the ashes out of his pipe against
the brick of the fireplace. “I didn't know about that.
And it’s quite clear Mister Grolheim didn’t know it,
either”

Don said: “What kind of a blackmail proposition
did he put up to you?”

“Ah ... that's a rather rough term to use, isn't it?”

“What the hell else can you call it?” Don retorted.
“You're going to have to pay for the sables a second
time, else they wouldn't release the coat ... or our
men. Only reason you'd pay would be to avoid
publicity. Well, let me tell you, there's bound to be
a mess of publicity anyhow, now there's been a
murder. | can’t help that; what | may be able to do is
help get our men out of the hands of some murder-
ous bastards. And the first thing | need to know is
exactly what kind of a deal you made with them.”

“Even,” Rettjer said softly, “if my telling you
should cause your friends to suffer for it? Because
that’s part of the deal, Mister Cadee. That | tell no
one of the terms. Otherwise, your employees may
regret it”

“You'll tell me” Don was brusque. “You'll tell me
here and now. Because | know just how much cause
Jim Preston and Myron Grolheim have had to regret
it already”

“Suppose”—Rettjer eyed him speculatively—"I
think it wiser to refuse your request?”

“I might,” Don said, “be able to make you change
your mind.’
CHAPTER 19

FIFTY THOUSAND
IN SMALL BILLS

THE FINANCIER ROSE, SAUNTERED TO THE
fireplace. “A lot of people have tried to make me
change my mind, Mister Cadee.” He picked up a
brass poker from the fire set on the brick hearth. “I
suppose you would go to the police?”

“To the newspapers,’ Don said. “No city desk
could pass up a story about a prominent indus-
trialist, a celebrated television star, a crown sable
coat—and an extortion attempt that involved
murder. By the way, if you pay off the blackmailers,
you might wind up charged as an accessory.”

Rettjer bent to poke at a smoldering log; his face
was momentarily hidden. “It seems to me your
Mister Grolheim is the accessory, if not the principal.
He was one of the very few who knew about the
sables, knew when and where they were to be deliv-
ered. He practically admitted that he was to share in
the ransom if it was paid. Now you tell me one of his

126
Spencer Dean 127

partners in crime was found beaten to death in his
house. Yet you claim your interest is in getting him
out of the hands of the gang.”

“I don't believe Grolheim is a thief or an extortion-
ist, much less a murderer”

Rettjer turned around. “How did you know the
sables were to be returned?”

“Grolheim called me up, too.”

“What did he say?”

“That arrangements had been made to have the
coat delivered to Miss Inez sometime this evening.”

“You know”—Rettjer swung the poker idly—"the
newspapers might make something out of the facts
that a couple of Ambletts employees left the store
with the sables and one of them later called you up,
notified you that a proposition had been made to
me about the return of the merchandise. Doesn't put
your store in a very favorable light”

“Depends how it's put,” Don said. “There are
witnesses who can prove that one of our men was
slugged while attempting to protect the store's
property. | can testify that | was given a fairly brutal
workover while trying to trace the garment. And
from the way Grolheim talked to me on the phone,
I'd say he was aware that his own life is in danger”

“That wasn't my impression.”

“You don't know the man.’

“He seemed absolutely unconcerned about any-
thing except the payment demanded, absolutely
cold-blooded”

“That's the point” Don said. “Grolheim is anything
but coldblooded. He's normally tense and jumpy.
They have him buffaloed in some way ... with a gun
128 Murder On Delivery

at his back. Or a threat of torture”

“Under the circumstances you think it would be
foolish to believe he would keep his word?”

“About the coat? They'll send it back. What else
can they do with it? It’s not negotiable like your secu-
rities. But I'm not worried about the sables. | want
Jim Preston and Myron Grolheim back ... if it isn't too
late”

“Your buyer was explicit on that score; he said
there'd be no further difficulties of any kind, once
the transaction was completed.”

“He may have believed that. He might not know
about the murder. They may have kept him in the
dark about Jim Preston. But there'll be plenty of
difficulties for the other members of the gang—and
they know it, whether Grolheim does or not”

“Then you suggest | go through with the plan?”

“How can | tell until | know what you agreed to
do?”

Rettjer replaced the poker, straightened up. “I'm
to have fifty thousand in small bills packed in a brief
case. At six o'clock someone will call me at the Buck-
inghurst apartment to tell me what to do with the
money. At seven another call will notify me where to
pick up the coat” He went to the bar. “Sounds like a
Grade-B movie, doesn't it?”

“Did Grolheim say you were to deliver the brief
case yourself?”

“No. Only that | should follow instructions to
the letter and, of course, refrain from notifying the
authorities. Drink?”

“I can use one’

“Scotch?”
Spencer Dean 129

“And water. Thanks. How would it be if you gave
me the brief case, let me deliver it?”

Rettjer clattered ice cubes into glasses. “I'm
beginning to change my mind about you, Mister
Cadee. | will admit that my preconception about a
department store detective wasn't too flattering.
Evidently | was wrong in your case. You have a hell of
a nerve to ask me to hand over fifty thousand dollars
to a man I've never seen before in my life. But this
seems to be a circumstance where a hell of a nerve is
needed. How will you operate?”

Don took the highball. “Have to play it by ear. Ill
be at the Buckinghurst by six and take it from there”

“Even though it may jeopardize your own men?”

“They're already jeopardized ... up to here. | may
be able to convince the contact man for the gang
that it will be a break for all concerned if they'll turn
Preston and Grolheim loose. Whatever happens, it
won't affect your coat deal”

“May affect you.”

“Calculated risk. You know about that sort of
thing. You're taking a few yourself” Don thought the
financier was relieved at the idea of having someone
else handle the ransom matter. “Miss Inez suspects
your wife of sending those jingles, has an idea Missus
Rettjer may have connived at having the sables
stolen”

“A natural enough conjecture but without the
slightest foundation.” Rettjer smiled; the smile trans-
formed his hard features, making him suddenly very
likable. “Tell you something, Mister Cadee. A woman
has to care a lot about a man to be jealous of him.
My wife doesn’t care that much about me; she’s not
130 Murder On Delivery

jealous, not even interested.”

“Then why did she go to the studio this morning?”

“She thought | might be there. She had been
trying to reach me here at the office. | was out. Far
as | knew she was flying to the Bahamas ... but she’s
always changing her mind at the last minute.” He
waved the pipe stem. “It had nothing to do with the
coat, you may be sure. | have told Miss Inez that she
might look closer to her own establishment for the
author of those creepy couplets”

“Ascloseas...?

“Her maid. Frances resents me; | once suggested
she should be discharged. She's always asking for
increases; she gets more right now than either of
my secretaries. Fancies she ought to be paid off for
keeping quiet about my visits to the apartment,
| suppose. Neither Miss Inez nor | believe in start-
ing that; once you begin to hand out hush money,
there's no end to it. Besides, there's nothing in
particular for us to hide. I'm fond of Lily; she likes
me. We don't broadcast it but we are certainly not
ashamed of it”

Don raised his eyebrows. “Not fifty thousand dol-
lars’ worth?”

“Oh no. Not at all. The ransom for the coat is
another matter. | want her to have those sables; |
have gone to considerable trouble and expense to
see she does have them. Putting up the additional
money may seem like a high premium in order to
protect my original investment—perhaps if | had
thought | could get a duplicate | might have turned
down Mister Grolheim'’s offer. But there's no such
thing as a duplicate. It might be two or three years
Spencer Dean 131

before | could have another one made up; it takes
that long to have the skins matched. By that time |
might be dead. Or she might. | want her to have it
now. So ... | will have that brief case ready for you at
six tonight.”

“You're not telling Miss Inez the details of the
arrangement?”

“You are the only one who knows.”

“Better that way.” Don put his glass on the bar.
“You might have another call from Mister Grolheim,
before this evening.”

“What makes you think so?”

“Afternoon papers will carry the story of that dead
man. It may rattle the rest of the gang. They might
even want to move up the time for the delivery of the
money.’

“I'll let you know if that happens.”

“At the store. Leave a message with my secretary.’
CHAPTER 20

MAX“THE BURNER”
TILLSON

PASSING THE NEWSSTAND INTHE LOBBY ON HIS WAY
out, Don received a mild jolt; Max's pale eyes and
wolfish fangs sneered up at him from a photograph
occupying the front page of a pinkish tabloid. The
scarehead said:

HUNT THRILL KILLER
IN TEENAGER’S DEATH
Don bought a copy, read the “Story on Page Two”
riding uptown in a cab. Evidently Dimmock and
Quinton had made quick identification from the
youth's fingerprints:

Max “The Burner” Tillson, 16, recently
released from Bronx Boys Correctional
Institution, was found dead this morn-
ing in the West End Avenue residence

132
Spencer Dean 133

of a wealthy fur man, Myron Grolheim.
Police investigating a broken areaway
door discovered the body, brutally
mutilated. Except for the murdered
teenager, there was no one in the
three-story house. An intensive search
is underway for Grolheim, who was known
to be in the city yesterday. Tillson
had been released from the reformatory
November first after serving five months
of a six months’ term for the theft
of a tobacco distributor’s truck.

The rest was a rewrite man’s sensationalism,

a suggestion —in the form of a query—asking
whether the boy might have been a victim of some
homicidal sadist, without mentioning Grolheim
specifically. The background for this seemed to be
that Tillson had once belonged to a teenage gang,
the Mott Avenue Malays, so known because they
liked to boast of running amuck among their juvenile
enemies.

You hit it on the nose. The kid had been a jumper.
When the cops find out about the stolen sables,
they'll figure that Max had inside information from My
Grolheim and was put out of the way to keep the fact
quiet. That'll be your fault, boy: you had a chance to
tell Dimmock about Max and his side-kick trailing My
for days ... and you said nothing. The Homicide boys
will have good reason to feel you've been covering up
an inside job, too.

Getting out of the cab in front of the Berkowsky
building, he felt suddenly very weary. The strain of
134 Murder On Delivery

not knowing whether you're playing it the right way,
boy. But you gave your word to Ruth Preston ... and
while there's a chance Jim may get out of this all right;
you wouldn't want to play it any other way.

The offices of Wolheim Berkowsky & Sons
were on the ground floor, facing Seventh Avenue.
Gloomy, high-ceilinged, paneled in dark walnut,
with old-fashioned lighting fixtures and somber steel
engravings such as used to be popular around the
turn of the century. But there was nothing out of
date about Morris Berkowsky. The junior vice-pres-
ident was Brooks Brothers and Ivy League and Park
Avenue: tall and rangy and briskly businesslike.

He took Don into an office with scores of framed
and signed photographs on the walls, a social gal-
lery, ladies of the haut monde.

“Miss Gates didn't tell me just what you have in
mind, Mister Cadee, but | gathered it had to do with
a certain garment we made for your store.”

“That's correct. The crown sable coat was
hijacked last night before My Grolheim could deliver
it to the customer”

Berkowsky didn't seem to be surprised. “You were
covered? By insurance in transit?”

“I'm not certain. But Ambletts isn't trying to evade
responsibility for payment. We're told the garment
will be returned undamaged; anyhow the purchaser
isn't going to renege on the deal. But a couple of our
men were taken along with the coat Mister Grolheim
and one of my best Protection men, Jim Preston.
Ambletts is more concerned about the men than the
merchandise, Mister Berkowsky.”

“You say Myron is in the hands of these
Spencer Dean 135

hijackers?” Berkowsky was puzzled. “I spoke to him
only an hour ago.”

“I talked to him this morning, too,” Don said. “He
called up to say the coat would be returned and that
he would also be free in a day or so. But | think he
was acting under duress.”

“It didn't seem so to me. The reason | wasn't too
surprised to hear about the theft was that Myron
wanted to know if we could suggest another cus-
tomer who might be interested in buying the coat if
the sale fell through.” Berkowsky frowned. “It struck
me as a queer question, though of course we do run
up against instances where the purchaser is unable
to take some expensive garment and we do have to
look around for another customer. But Myron would
be more likely to know of a possible taker for this
rather ... extraordinary garment... than | would. So
it threw me a bit”

“What did you tell him?”

“Why—that we would make some discreet inqui-
ries, let him know. My first supposition was that the
gentleman who ordered the coat had had some
disagreement with the lady for whom it had been
designed.”

“Nothing like that. He still wants to give her the
coat even though he’s going to have to pay a ransom
in addition to your price”

“No kidding!” The frown deepened. “Certainly
be the most expensive item of apparel the world
has ever seen, then. But I'm more baffled than ever,
Mister Cadee. You see, Myron gave no indication
that his personal safety was involved. He did sound
rather vague, but | laid that to his distress at having
136 Murder On Delivery

such a large transaction screwed up. As near as | can
recall, the closest he came to hinting there might be
something wrong was to say his plans hadn't worked
out quite as he had expected. You're sure there is no
mistake about his having been abducted along with
the coat?”

“You mean do | believe he might have been in on
the steal?” Don asked. “l don't | think he's in great
danger. As soon as the ransom has been paid over,
there's a good chance he'll go the way this kid went.”
He held out the paper.

Berkowsky turned to Page Two, scowling. After a
moment he looked up. “This seems to say Myron was
the murderer”

“He wasn't. You know him, you know he wouldn't
have the heart to kill anyone”

“I would have said that’s right Still—"

“The paper's whooping up a sensation. It didn't
have the facts because the police didn't have them.
| had been warned by My not to give them any
dope, otherwise he and Jim Preston might not be
allowed to go free; Don said. “Now I'm damn sure
that a crook who would kill one of his own partners
in crime wouldn't trunk twice about finishing off
a couple of witnesses to his misdeeds. These calls
from My—he talked to our customer as well as to you
and me—add up to just one thing. They're fixing to
make him the patsy ... for the hijack and the murder
of this Max as well.”

Berkowsky nodded. “If | had to testify in court
about that phone call, it would certainly make him
seem like one of the gang, that’s true”

“It comes down to this,” Don said. “| have to
Spencer Dean 137

locate this bunch of highbinders before they get the
ransom.”

“If there's any way our firm can help...”

“Not unless some of your people can recognize
the man who worked with this Max Tillson when
Preston was slugged outside Miss Inez’ apartment.”
Don described the fellow as Salvatore had—the
broken nose, the bulgy pug-dog eyes, the slimy
smile, the sapphire ring. He added, “And Grolheim
said he might have been an Italian.”

“He never worked for us,” Berkowsky said. “I'll
go further; | doubt if he ever worked in a fur factory.
Very few Italians in this business, very few. Of course
he may have been a truck driver—but that star sap-
phire doesn’t make it seem likely.”

“No,” Don agreed. “One more thing. How long
have you known My?”

“Ten or twelve years,” Berkowsky said. “He’s
always had a first-class reputation in the trade, not
especially in a sociable sense, but as an individual of
integrity. | would be unhappy to revise my opinion of
him”

“That's all | wanted to know.” Don said he'd keep
Wolheim Berkowsky & Sons in touch with develop-
ments, then said good-by.

As he came out of the building, Baisha Gates
rushed across the sidewalk, clutched his arm. “|
didn't want to barge in while you were busy with
Morrie, but | simply had to catch you before you
went back to the store, Mister Cadee”

“Why?” he asked, “Did you latch onto something
at Sari Soeurs?”

“Oh, | have the list of their mink minxes”"—she
138 Murder On Delivery

giggled foolishly—"but | can't tell whether it'll be
any help to you or not” She took a sheet of crested
notepaper out of her coat pocket. “Here ... and don't
blame me for all the Miss Joneses and Miss Whites
and Miss Johnsons they gave me. | know they aren't
the ladies’ real names and they know it, too, but
what are they to do if some gentleman says a blue
pastel is for plain Miss Smith when her name is prob-
ably Hortense Hassenpfeffer!”

“You didn't rush over here just to give me this
list?”

“Oh no.” She whipped off her horn-rims, peered
up at him anxiously. “l waylaid you because Miss
Kahn said you mustn't come back to the office”

“That so?”

“Not until you've talked to her, anyway. There are
two policemen waiting with a warrant for you.”
CHAPTER 21

THE SLASHER

DON TOOK BAISHA'S ARM. “LET'S HOP ACROSS TO
that drugstore. Unless you're afraid of being seen
with a desperate criminal”

“I'm not a bit afraid.” She snuggled against him
crossing the street “| always said you'd be one of
the ten most wanted men, Mister Cadee. But | didn't
mean it in the police sense. If there's anything | can
dotohelpyou...”

“There is. Call Miss Kahn from that booth, give her
the number of the phone, have her ring back soon as
she can get away from my office” He ran interference
past the pushing lunch-hour crowd two and three
deep at the busy fountain.

In the booth a stout man spoke earnestly to
the phone, beating the air with a hairy hand for
emphasis.

Baisha said: “What did you do that put the police
after you?”

“I went up to My Grolheim’s house to see what
might have happened to him. They want to know

139
140 Murder On Delivery

about it; | don't want to tell ‘em until My gets back”
He scanned the list from Sari Soeurs. Many of the
names he recognized as being on Ambletts’ No-Lim-
it-to-Credit list. A few were familiar from the financial
pages of the daily press. There was a scattering of
anonymities, the noms de-joie for mistresses of men
in the uppermost tax brackets. And ... two thirds
down the typed column, the name of Missus Norman
Rettjer.

The stout man shouted an imprecation, slammed
the receiver at the hook, backed out of the booth
still muttering to himself.

Don said: “Don't tell Becky you're with me,

Baisha. Just have her buzz you back.”

She huddled over the phone dial.

Don wondered what might be the significance
of Missus Rettjer's ownership of a Sari Soeurs mink.
Had she lent it to a friend? Given it to a less affluent
relative? Sold it... within a year of purchasing it?
None of them seemed possibilities. Anyhow, since
the Homicide hounds had made such a swiftly effi-
cient identification of Max, it was more than likely
they already knew about the brunette in the tur-
quoise gown, knew who she was and what had been
her connection with the dead “Burner”

Baisha said: “That's it, that’s fine,’ started to edge
out of the booth.

Don put his hand between her shoulder blades.
“Stay there. Stick with it. Others waiting to use the
booth. Have to keep ‘em waiting”

She nodded. “I'll pretend to be talking ... but I'll
hold the hook down so nobody’ll notice”

“That's the idea." The pneumatic hammers began
Spencer Dean 141

to pound at his ears again. The store was hot, the air
was close. Smells of frying hamburger and chocolate
malteds mingled with the odors of sweaty clothing
and too strong perfumes. An impatient line of the
thwarted telephone-minded pressed against him
irritably.

It seemed much longer than the four minute his
wristwatch indicated before the phone bell rang
sharply and Baisha Gates let the hook fly up.

“All alone now, Miss Kahn? ... Yes, yes ... he's right
here... I'll put him on”

Don squeezed past her. “Hello, Becky. Gendarmes
still in the offing?”

“Yes indeed.” His secretary seemed harassed.
“That Sergeant Quinton has been camped beside my
desk for the last hour. And Lieutenant Dimmock was
at your desk for a whiles— waiting for you to call in,
| suppose—but he left about ten minutes ago to see
Mister Stolz. I've been on pins and needles for fear
you might walkin so | had Alice posted out in the
hall to warn you.”

“That's using your head. About Miss Gates, too.
Did they tell you what the warrant charges?”

“Dimmock wouldn't utter a peep. But the ser-
geant loosened up after the lieutenant left. It seems
someone saw you leaving Mister Grolheim’s house
this morning, described your bruised face.”

“Did he say who saw me?”

“No. But"—Becky hesitated—“he did mention
there was a girl with you. And you were carrying a
suitcase.”

“Sounds sort of incriminating, doesn't it?”

“Now, Mister Cadee ... | didn't suggest any such
142 Murder On Delivery

thing!”

“Just jesting, Becky. Did you tell Quinton when
you expect me back?”

“After lunch sometime. | had to say something...”

“Of course. You did exactly right.”

“Well, | don’t know. | really didn’t know what to
tell the captain.”

“Captain? What captain?”

“Eadie. At the precinct. You know him.”

“Sure. But | didn’t know he was in the act”

“It wasn't about having you arrested. He wanted
to speak to you about that girl we sent to the hospi-
tal, that slasher”

“What about her?”

“Captain Eadie said that under the circumstances
he'd just have the charges against her filed unless
he heard from you that Ambletts is going to insist on
prosecution.”

Don stared at the penciled doodlings and scrib-
bled phone numbers on the wall of the booth. What
the hell had Eadie been blithering about? “Did he
mention what circumstances he had reference to,
Becky?”

“No, he didn't. All he said was that doctors were
like lawyers —if you could afford to pay for the right
ones you could prove anything you wanted to. He
said he thought you'd understand. But | didn't”

“We're in the same boat. It's Greek to me. But I'll
see if | can work out a translation. Did Quinton know
it was the precinct calling me?”

“Oh no. | took the message in shorthand. The
sergeant was looking over my shoulder but | guess it
was Greek to him.”
Spencer Dean 143

“No doubt.” He realized that Eadie’s crack about
doctors must mean that the girl had been certified
sane at the Psych Ward. But then why had she been
released . .. with a thousand dollars or so of mutilated
merchandise still to be paid for? Well, hell, you've
more important fish to fry. Her case will have to wait.
“Anything else on the fire, Becky?”

“Mister Stolz has been calling about those dam-
aged alligator bags.”

“Has he, now?” With a hundred-thousand-dollar
coat numbered among the missing, Stolz has to worry
about a slasher? What goes? “Just let him stew; it’s
his normal condition.”

“Right. And what'll | say to the sergeant if he asks
whether I've heard from you?”

“Lie like a lady. Sib’ll get in touch with you after
lunch! As he left the booth, he had to sidestep an
elbowing woman who muttered something about
“people who spend their lunch hour on the phone”

Baisha grasped his arm as they struggled to
the street “Why do they want to arrest you, Mister
Cadee?”

“They think | know a lot more about My Grolheim
than | really do. And by the way, they're looking for
you, too.”

“Eeeel” She squeaked in excitement “For me?”

“To find out what you know about his
disappearance.”

“But—I don't know anything about it”

“You do, though. And you have to be careful not
to tell them ... about the crown sable coat”

“If you say | shouldn't, | won't breathe a syllable
about it” She quivered with the intensity of her
144 Murder On Delivery

pledge.

“It may be bad for My if you let anything slip.”

“I won't, | won't! Wild horses couldn't—"

“And one thing more. Forget to mention you met
me outside the store”

“You know you can trust me, Mister Cadee.”

“Sure of it, Baisha. Thanks for your help and your
discretion” He gave her a smile, a brotherly pat,
hailed a cruising cab, slid in.

The driver looked over his shoulder inquiringly.

“Bellevue Hospital,” Don said. “Front entrance.”

You may be shooting off at a tangent, checking on
Captain Eadie’s cryptic message. On the other hand,
Bob Stolz is no dope; he knows you're not going to get
sidetracked on anything that doesn't affect the safety
of Jim Preston and My Grolheim. So there must be
some connection... .

He found the Psychiatric Ward, located the super-
visor, stated his errand.

But the elderly-lady in the lace cap shook her
head. “We have no record of any such admission.
You say you don't know the patient's name?”

“No. But the police brought her here a couple
of hours ago. From Ambletts Fifth Avenue.” He
described her as carefully as he could. “A good-look-
ing teenager, nicely groomed, well dressed. She
refused to give us any name or address.”

The supervisor raised one eyebrow. “Possibly she
was taken to some other hospital. We have no such
detention patient held for observation.” She went to
the desk, came back with a typed list mounted on
a clip board, held it out for his inspection. “See for
yourself”
CHAPTER 22

PROMINENT STRING
PULLERS

DON GLANCED AT THE CLIP BOARD.“NAMES ARE NO
help. | told you—I don’t know this girl's name. But |
know she was brought here. If she’s not here now, |
want to know why you let her go”

“Sorry” The supervisor was aloof, apparently
disinterested. “Unless you have the patient's name,
we could under no consideration give out any
information.”

He reached for his wallet, thinking that identifica-
tion might to some extent offset a poor impression
created by his bunged-up face, his fatigue. “Here’s
my card—" he said, before he realized that he had no
wallet, merely a few dollars he had borrowed from
Sibyl ... and no Ambletts cards whatever.

She waited a moment before turning away dis-
dainfully. “You will excuse me—"

“Not yet.” He tapped her on the shoulder. “Which
doctor is in charge of this ward?”

145
146 Murder On Delivery

“Our chief psychiatrist is not here at this time of
day.” She was stiffly resentful at his touching her.
“These are not visiting hours, either. | must ask you
to leave now.”

“I'm not leaving” Don was chagrined and irri-
tated. “Not until | find out why you're stalling about
this kid. What's the name of the doctor who's in
charge here right now?”

“Doctor Hamlin” She retreated behind her desk.
“But he can give you no more information than 1”

“We'll see about that. Where'll | find him?”

“He is on a tour of the ward. You cannot disturb
him.”

“No? He'll have the hell disturbed out of him if
you keep on giving me the run-around.” He went to
the desk angrily, “You can't brush me off with double
talk. | deal with too much of that in Protection work.
Get hold of this Hamlin before | bring in a court order
to have you produce this prisoner”

“We can't produce a patient who hasn't been
admitted”

“A police matron and a plain-clothes man brought
her in. Their Captain at the precinct advised me
that somebody had pulled a fast one to keep her
under cover. What are you people trying to hide? A
suicide?”

“Really!” Suddenly she was on the defensive.
“Really—I am unable to furnish the information you
wish”

“Okay. Then call police headquarters on that
phone. Let me talk to—" He reached for the phone.

“No! ... Wait! ... Don't!" Her eyes betrayed panic.
“Step down the hall to the Visitors’ Room. | will ask
Spencer Dean 147

Doctor Hamlin to confirm what | have told you.”

“That's more like it” He stalked down the corri-
dor, with weariness sweeping over him like heavy
surf. The hospital smell was depressing, the sight of
a nurse padding into a room carrying a canvas jacket
with dangling tapes was ominous.

Maybe this is where My Grolheim ought to be. No
man in his right mind would have called up Ruth Pres-
ton, Norman Rettjer, Morris Berkowsky and calmly
discussed a bloody crime as “some sort of mistake.”
It wasn't rational to refer to the hijacking, the attack
on Press, the murder of Max as a “misunderstanding”
which would be corrected to everyone's satisfaction
if those concerned simply sat tight and kept quiet.
Grolheim must be off his rocker. Or maybe you are,
boy! Maybe that clout on the cranium was too much
for you!

But he knew better. He was physically exhausted
from the beating, mentally weary from lack of sleep,
that was all.

There was no one in the Visitors’ Room. He
brooded at the barred windows, the gray sluggish-
ness of the East River seen far below through the
dust-gray windows.

It might have been better, he thought, if he had
called Bob Stolz from the drugstore, to learn why
Bob considered the relatively slight damage wrought
by the slasher as in any way important compared to
the loss of a hundred-thousand-dollar coat, to the
vastly greater problem of what had happened to
Press, to Grolheim. But then, he realized, Stolz would
have had Lieutenant Dimmock there at his elbow
and couldn't have spoken freely.
148 Murder On Delivery

A tall, spare man with the stooped shoulders of
a professor and a deeply lined face came down the
hall at an unhurried gait. He smiled with his eyes. “I
am Doctor Hamlin.” He held out his hand.

“Don Cadee, Chief of Store Protection at
Ambletts, Doctor”

“You've been having a little difficulty with Miss
Stevens?”

“Your supervising nurse? She was giving me the
brush-off; | can't waste time horsing around with her.
We picked up a teenage girl after she'd destroyed a
lot of valuable merchandise out of sheer malicious-
ness. Ordinarily we don't prosecute such cases, gives
other delinquents ideas. Normal procedure is to
obtain a confession, get in touch with the parents,
arrange for payment of the damaged articles. But
this kid refused to give us her name, She was arro-
gant and decidedly unrepentant. She as much as
said that what she wanted was to be arrested and
paraded in court so she could humiliate someone,
get even with her parents possibly”

“Not an uncommon motive with modern youth,’
the doctor said amiably.

“No. We don't like to cooperate with such vin-
dictiveness, though. But we couldn't turn her loose
without some information to help us in collecting for
the nylons and lingerie and handbags she'd slashed
with bits of razor blades. So | arranged to have her
brought here by a police matron and a detective. She
was to be committed for observation, under deten-
tion, subject to the store's disposal of her case. Now
I'm told she was never admitted to the Psych Ward.
| know she was. I'm fed up with evasive tactics, with
Spencer Dean 149

buck passing. What goes?”

The psychiatrist sighed.“ don't blame you for
being resentful, Mister Cadee. But you mustn't
blame Miss Stevens, either. She had her orders. So
had I. However, I'm sure our instructions don’t apply
to you; they were simply intended to squelch news-
paper scandal”

“The police captain at the precinct suggested
there had been some string pulling.”

“Quite correct. Rather prominent string pullers.
| must admit | was somewhat surprised. Of course
it was immediately apparent, at the brief prelim-
inary examination, that the young lady was not a
psychotic. Thirty years ago she would merely have
been a bad child; nowadays we try to understand
such cases before we attempt to punish them. As a
preliminary to a later revaluation we administered a
mild tranquilizer, one of the new meprobamates.”

“I'd say calming down was what she needed
most.”

“Yes. Well, | chatted with her for a few minutes but
she didn't relax her rebelliousness. She was boast-
fully confident that she wouldn't be here long ... and
she was right about that.” Doctor Hamlin glanced at
his watch. “She hadn't been in the ward much more
than an hour when a formidable group showed up
here, inquiring for her”

“Lawyers?”

“Ch yes. A brace of attorneys, equipped with
impressive writs of habeas and what not. There was
also a Doctor Volney, who represented himself as
the girl's personal physician of some years’ stand-
ing. And one of the country’s foremost psychiatrists,
150 Murder On Delivery

Leon Shlemm. Are you acquainted with Doctor
Shlemm?”

“Only by reputation.’

“A splendid reputation ... and well deserved.
Matter of fact, | studied under Doctor Shlemm at
Johns Hopkins; my respect for his opinion would
be, naturally, of the highest degree. So when he said
that he was prepared to certify that Miss Rettjer was
perfectly—"

Don broke in: “The financiers daughter?”

“Miss Joyna Rettjer, right. In some way, possibly
by promising a reward to that police matron—
though that is merely guesswork on my part—the girl
had managed to get word to her parents. The battery
of learned counsel and medical authority rushed to
her rescue”

That explains Bob Stolz's anxiety to get hold of you.
Probably Cap Eadie'd talked to him when you couldn't
be reached. Stolz would have agreed to having the
case filed, all right. That would have made the girl's
release from the hospital legal even though irregular.
So much it does explain ... but it adds to the pile of
puzzles that still need solving. “You couldn't hold her
against all that pressure, Doctor”

“Frankly, we didn’t want to. Whether it was the
influence of the tranquilizing drug, or whether the
flame of the young lady’s rage had more or less
burned itself out—as often happens, it's difficult to
sustain an emotional outburst of that violent nature
for any great length of time if there is no mental
imbalance— whatever the reason, Miss Rettjer was
as meek as you please at the time of her release.”

“Did she give any reason for her maliciousness in
Spencer Dean 151

our store?”

Doctor Hamlin pondered a moment. “You'd better
ask Doctor Shlemm as to that. All | can tell you is that
when Doctor Volney asked her why she had behaved
so badly, Miss Rettjer replied: ‘I'd have cut her to
ribbons if I'd had the chance but | knew | couldn't
so | took it out on them because they started it.” He
smiled again. “Sort of incoherent excuse an over-
wrought teenager is likely to make. It may have no
relevance whatever”

“I'd say it's loaded with relevance,’ Don said
gravely.
CHAPTER 23

TEENAGE TERROR

THE HAT-CHECK GIRL AT THE RED BOAR TOOK HIS
coat with a knowing glance at his bruised face. “And
how does the other fellow look, Mister Cadee?”

“Worse than | do, Millie” He thought of the fea-
tures battered beyond recognition, down in the City
Morgue.

“That's one | should have had tickets for," she
smiled.

He gave her his hat and went toward the tiny bar.

Sibyl slid off her stool. “Our table is ready.” She
peered anxiously at him. “You look terribly tired.

“Been dealing with some difficult people” He
followed the headwaiter to the banquette, ordered a
double Rob Roy, briefed Sibyl on the interview with
Norman Rettjer.

She said nothing until he had finished, then
shook her head in disapproval. “You'll only get your-
self beaten up again, trying to trap them when you
hand over that fifty thousand. They will be expect-
ing something like that or they wouldn't have had

152
Spencer Dean

Grolheim warn you about not calling in the police”

“That's right,” he admitted. “But I'm not planning
to trick them. Only to bargain with them. For Press
and My’

“How can you bargain when you turn over the
money? They'll have the cash and the coat... as well
as their prisoners. What can you offer them?”

“Biggest thing in the world, Sib. A chance for
their lives. They're facing that armchair, our modern
equivalent of the Iron Maiden. | may be able to show
them how to escape that: they won't turn down a
deal, you can bet on that”

“That's like betting the lion won't sneeze when
you have your head in its mouth. | don't like any part
of it, Don”

“I'm not exactly looking forward to it myself”

The smoky bite of the Scotch felt good to his throat.
“We may be able to work the thing out another way
before that six o'clock deadline ... in which case |
won't need to make that rendezvous.” He told her
about the message from Captain Eadie, the call
from Stolz, the trip to the Psych Ward, his talk with
Hamlin.

She forgot her soufflé and her sherry, listening
wide-eyed until he quoted the slasher’s cryptic
explanation of her actions.

“I knew I'd seen her picture in the paper recently.
Joyna Rettjer. Of course. It was a photograph of that
rock-and-roll mélée at Greenwich.”

“She was arrested? In Connecticut?”

“With a bunch of other teenage terrors. They were
having one of those juvenile open-house shindigs ...
and they began to out dare each other”

153
154 Murder On Delivery

“The if-you-don't-you're-chicken routine.”

“Yes. As | recall it, she and a couple of other haut
monde hoodlums drove somebody's foreign sports
car along those black-top roads at seventy; finally
clipped a truck full of live turkeys and overturned it.
This Rettjer hellion and one of the other girls were
sporting turkey feathers in their hair when the pho-
tograph was taken ... | suppose at the police station.”

“Must have embarrassed the bejeezus out of our
philandering financier. And from the glimpse | had
of his haughty lady, I'd say it would have shocked
her right down to her patrician heels” He worked
on the London broil a moment. “That might have
given the brat an idea. All she'd have to do to get
her way would be to threaten another police court
appearance.”

“But how could she possibly decide on anything
as outright vicious as slashing valuable merchan-
dise? And why pick on Ambletts?”

Don gave the waiter their order for baba au rhum
and coffee. “Somehow Joyna must have heard about
her father’s affair with Lily Inez. Maybe felt he was
slighting darling daughter in favor of the sexy star”

“Or perhaps,’ Sibyl suggested, “the girl simply
took her mother’s side of the triangular argument
Happens in the b.f’s”

“Either way, she'd be burned up at Lily Inez. Espe-
cially if she heard about that crown sable coat”

“Girls a whole lot more stable emotionally than a
rock-and-roll teener might go green-eyed at learning
an older woman was going to get a present like that
from Papa. But how could she get even with Lily Inez
by ruining our hundred-dollar handbags?”
Spencer Dean 155

“I'm going on guesswork,” he said. “But | think
what she meant by that crack—‘I'd have cut her to
ribbons if I'd had the chance, but | couldn’t’—was
that she had tried to scare her father into canceling
the order for the coat ... and failed. Then she'd done
her damnedest to frighten Lily Inez into refusing
the sables ... and also failed at that—or was afraid
that she hadn't succeeded. So as a last-ditch try, the
brats twisted mind fixed on pressuring her father by
threatening another humiliating run-in with the law
on a more serious charge than reckless driving.”

Sibyl didn't understand. “Are you saying Joyna
Rettjer arranged the hijacking?”

“No. Not that I'd put it past her. She may have set
the scheme in motion, intentionally or otherwise.

... | can't tell. But I'd better bring you up to date”
He related the details of the téte-a-téte in the star's
dressing room, recited some of the jingles.

Sibyl repeated one, incredulously.

“But don the sables once and |
Will guarantee that you will die!

It does sound high-schoolish.”

“Didn't sound so to Miss Inez”

“Of course not... those horrible rhymes would
have made any woman a nervous wreck.”

“Couldn't have helped her beauty sleep much,
Don said. “Before | left Bellevue | tried to reach
Rettjer by phone. His office said he'd left for the day,
claimed they didn't know how | could get hold of
him. Then | tried the Rettjer residence on East Nine-
ty-Second. Butler there said none of the family were
156 Murder On Delivery

home, told me that Missus Rettjer had gone to the
Bahamas.”

“But you said you saw her at the studio”

“I did. She was mad as hell about something.

On the hunt for her trouble-making teenager, most
likely. Whether Joyna got her message through from
the hospital to her mother or her father, deponent
sayeth not Doctor Volney could have told me ... but
he wasn't listed in the Manhattan phone book...

or Bronx or Brooklyn or Westchester. | did contact
Doctor Shlemm. He set me straight. Volney’s out in
Greenwich.”

“Where the Rettjer country place is”

“They live at Old Town Point, right Volney's office
gave me that much, though they couldn't say where
the doctor might be. And the telephone at Old Town
Point was dead as the old gray goose, too. So ... I'm
going out there right after | pay this check”

“If you can talk to this girl, you may be able to
unravel the whole ball of yarn—I see that” She
poked a fork, fretfully, at her baba au rhum. “It
seems as if I've wasted my morning.”

He reached across the table, caught hold of her
hand. “Sorry. Self-centered Cadee they call me down
at Centre Street. Please take an apology, Miss Forde.”

Sibyl smiled. “I did latch onto something ...
though it can't be as important as what you found
out about that rock-and-roller”

“Well, tell”

“I made about a dozen calls ... the hauts coutu-
riers on Fifty-Seventh and upper Madison ... but no
one could give me a lead about that turquoise gown.
Until | had what | modestly think was a middling
Spencer Dean

bright idea.”

“Don't fish. Facts first, pat on the back later”

“All right. | thought where I'd go if | wanted to buy
a glamour gown like that... if | didn't work at a high-
style store where | can get a discount”

“Where?”

“To a secondhand shop.”

“Ah,now ...”"

“But a very superior sort of secondhand shop.
One that doesn't stock ordinary hand-me-downs.
Only the best. Dresses, coats, gowns, that came orig-
inally from those swanky stores I'd just been visiting.
Where the ten best-dressed women turn in their
only-wear-them-onces ... and where a smart woman
can sometimes pick up a five-hundred-dollar Schi-
aparelli or Molyneux for a hundred or so”

“There is such a markdown market?”

“There is. It’s called My Cousin. | went there ...
and they knew the turquoise gown immediately;
they'd sold it only a month ago.”

“You're something, Sib. Who bought it?”

“They couldn't tell me. Until, later. Saleslady
who sold it won't be in until two. But they have
a record of all the original owners. And that tur-
quoise-and-spangles was a Jacques Worth, an
exclusive, one of a kind.”

“Owned by?”

“Lily Inez”

MY COUSIN

ONTHE WAY UP MADISON AVENUE IN THE TAXI SIBYL
said: “While | was waiting for you at the restaurant

| called up Ruth. | was afraid she might have heard
something on the radio about the police being after
Grolheim.”

“Had she?”

“She'd been out and bought an afternoon paper.”
“Left her low in the mind.” Don made it an assertion.

“Yes. But she didn't say much. Except to wonder
if the kidnappers would think you had called in the
police. | told her they must know better. Was | wrong
to try and keep her hopes buoyed up?”

“Of course not.” He thought of Ruth Preston's
message to her husband: “We are sitting tight, taking
no action, until you get home” He'd agreed to go
along with that promise but he hadn't stuck to his
word. The action he'd taken up on West End Avenue
last night had probably been the spark that touched
off Max's murder. Whether it would affect old Press
... that was a chance which had to be taken. “If Jim

158
Spencer Dean

is still alive, and if | can have a five minute talk with
these hijackers after the ransom is delivered, he'll be
home by tomorrow.”

“And you? Will you come back safe and sound?”

The cab pulled in to the curb before he could do
more than say “Why not?”—then he was helping her
out, paying the driver, glancing up at the flowery
script letters in white against black glass:

MY COUSIN
(Once removed)

In the modest display window was a single gown
of flaming orange tossed carelessly on a Directoire
sofa of white satin.

“Not the secondhand store of Second Avenue,
you see.” She led him inside. “Stan in show business
can't afford to wear a dress more than once, pub-
licly. Downgrades ‘em professionally. Still they can’t
afford to buy a three-fifty import and give it to the
maid after one wearing. So the TV and film actresses
send their ‘old’ clothes here on consignment; My
Cousin takes a percentage and does very nicely
indeed”

“Once removed,” Don said. “Very neat idea.” He
gazed at gowns on racks, ermine-trimmed capes on
manikins, shimmering silk, filmy lace, gold-embroi-
dered brocade.

Sibyl spoke to a gray-haired woman in a linen
smock. The gray-haired woman went to the rear of
the store, returned with a small, dark saleslady, also
in a smock.

“Miss Nelty may be able to help you, Miss Forde.

159
160 Murder On Delivery

Miss Nelty sold that sequined turquoise you asked
about”

Miss Nelty was eager to be of assistance. Yes, she
remembered the gown, remembered the customer
who bought it “Missus Chadbourne. She bought the
shoes Miss Inez had made to go with the gown, too.”

Sibyl said: “Is Missus Chadbourne a brunette?”

“Oh yes. The gown complimented her coloring
perfectly”

“Do you keep a record,” asked Sibyl, “of your
customers’ addresses? Can you tell us where Missus
Chadbourne lives?”

“We don't keep any customer records. But we do
have a mailing list ... to notify our friends of items
which might particularly interest them. However’ —
the saleswoman was apologetic—“I'm sure Missus
Chadbourne isn't in our mail file because she’s an
entertainer, a singer; they move around so much,
you know.”

“They certainly do,” Sibyl said. “Is she on
television?”

“I think she sings in a night club.” The sales-
woman was vague. “She did mention it but I've
forgotten ... The Top Hat? No, that wasn't it, but it
was something like that”

Don said: “The High Note, perhaps? On East
Fifty-Fourth?”

The saleswoman smiled brightly. “That's it. The
High Note. How stupid of me..."

“Easy to get confused,” Don assured her.“ sup-
pose Missus Chadbourne has bought a number of
gowns here?”

“Quite a few, yes”
Spencer Dean 161

“And has she"—he pursued the point—"bought
several which had originally been owned by Lily
Inez?”

“Yes indeed. As a matter of fact, | believe that all
of her purchases were of numbers made especially
for Miss Inez” The saleswoman nodded.

“Now, how,” Sibyl asked him after they had
thanked the saleswoman and were again on the
street, “how in the world did you guess that?”

“No guess at all” He smiled. “Scientific probing.
Well, maybe not so scientific. When | saw the sexy
lady at her apartment last night, | had the feeling
she knew more about the hijack than she'd admit.
Then, later, when she told me about those cockeyed
rhymes, | supposed that had been the information
she'd been hiding. That was a dumb diagnosis,
though it took me a while to realize it. At the apart-
ment she did her level best to postpone any police
investigation.”

“Wasn't that a natural reaction?”

“| thought so, at first. She and that big-domed
manager of hers claimed they were only concerned
about publicity, a scandal. That was the bunk...
| was slow to catch on. She wisecracked about
Rettjer's going out to Las Vegas to be with her, said
she'd warned him he shouldn't... but didn’t seem to
mind that it was known to the gossip scribblers.”

“Feminine instinct? ... To make the best of a bad
situation?”

“Not unless you call Rettjer’s instincts femi-
nine, too. He doesn't strike me that way. He made
it plain he didn't care too much one way or the
other whether it became known he was giving her
162 Murder On Delivery

a hundred-thousand-dollar gift. And when you
come right down to it, it wouldn't actually hurt her
professionally. She wouldn't be the first actress to
profit by being known as the mistress of a prominent
personage.”

“I can think of several others,’ Sibyl agreed.

“Think of how many phony publicity stories have
been planted in the press about ladies of the theater
having their jewels stolen. It couldn't really hurt her,
professionally, to hit the headlines in connection
with a crown sable coat. No, it wasn’t the possible
news break that scared her. But just when I'd man-
aged to figure that out, | learned about the screwball
daughter. | thought Lily Inez must have known about
Joyna and had been trying to smother that angle to
keep Rettjer from being hurt”

“But now you don't think so?”

“Hell, no. I'd told her one of the kidnappers had
been killed. Her manager had emphasized that the
police were in on the case. If Lily Inez had thought
Joyna was involved, she'd have rushed to warn
Rettjer right away. Instead she did all she could to
keep me from seeing him. So its a cinch there's
something else she’s holding back. All it could be is
that she knows one of the hijackers. Maybe the bru-
nette who wore her old clothes, hah?”

A frown puckered Sibyl’s forehead. “It could be
nothing more than the fact that Missus Chadbourne
can wear Lily Inez’ size without alterations, that she
likes the star's taste in clothes. If she bought one of
Miss Inez’ wear-it-once-and-sell-it-down-the-river
garments ... and liked it, she might well go back and
buy more from the same source.”
Spencer Dean 163

“Sure,” he said. “Sure. But how would she know
when one of the Lily-gilded items would be for sale?
She wasn't on My Cousin’s mailing list”

“Well, she might haunt the place. If she could
get a five-hundred-dollar exclusive for a third of its
original price, it would be worth it. I'm only trying
to see all sides of it. But the side that impresses me
is that the girl who helped to steal Lily Inez’ sables
also wears her hand-me-downs. You hit the nail on
the head, you're probably right about some connec-
tion between them. Now all we have to do is locate
Missus Chadbourne”

“May not be so simple.” He flagged a cab. “Park
Avenue and Fifty-fourth,” he told the driver.

Sibyl looked at him out of the corners of her eyes.
“You seem to know a lot about this High Note; you've
never taken me there”

“Never been in the joint in my life, shugie. But |
know what it'll be like. Horseshoe bar with a baby
grand inside. Raised banquettes so the patrons can
see the singer under the baby spot. Dim blue lighting
so you can't see the high prices on the liquor list.
And very dim, very blue lyrics.

“Doesn't sound terribly attractive. How much
would a ... a chanteuse earn in a place like that?”

“No idea. But | shouldn't think it would be enough
to pay for many of My Cousin’s fancy costumes.”

The cab stopped at a sidewalk awning decorated
with quarter notes, clefs, piano keyboards. The
driver said:

“It aint open till five. You want me to take you
somewheres else?”

Don said: “No, thanks. This is it” He helped Sibyl
164 Murder On Delivery

out.

The front door was locked. Inside a solitary light
showed above a bank of chromium-capped bottles.
A figure moved in the gloom beyond.

Don rapped on the glass with a quarter.

A face emerged from the shadows, approached
the door. A round, pale, unhappy face with sad eyes.
The eyes studied them, examined Sibyl, seemed sat-
isfied. The door was opened an inch.

“We don’t open until—"

“We just want to ask a question,” Don said
quickly. “Girl we know used to sing here ... name, of
Chadbourne. Know her?”

“She ain't here no more." The sad eyes showed no
interest.

“Can you tell us where we can find her?” Sibyl
asked.

“I heard she ain't in the business any more.
Somebody said she went out to Las Vegas couple
weeks ago, hit all the jackpots in town." The fat face
creased into a smile. “Maybe | should go out there,
try my luck. Can't be no worse'n it is here.
CHAPTER 25

CAKED WITH BLOOD

SIBYL MUSED: “WONDER IF MY PAL GEOFF MIGHT
have some dope on another entertainer who was in
Las Vegas at the same time Lily Inez was?”

“Uh-uh. A High Note singer wouldn't interest a
columnist like Geoffrey unless she was outstanding
... and | don’t mean her figure. Or unless she, too,
was letting Rettjer buy her chips.” Don steered her
toward Lexington Avenue.

“How little you understand the distaff side. No
woman who was trying to take Rettjer away from Lily
Inez would be stupid enough to buy and wear her
rival's discarded gowns. It couldn't have been that
way. But what if Rettjer’s wife hired this Missus Chad-
bourne to follow the love birds out there to round up
evidence for a divorce?”

“Slim possibility. I'll check on it when | get out to
Greenwich. Rettjer went to some pains to convince
me his wife doesn’t care enough about him to have
him trailed”

“Never underestimate a woman who's about to

165
166 Murder On Delivery

lose a fifty-million-dollar husband. Maybe she’s not
jealous; she can still be money-minded. Are you
going to drive out to Old Town Point?”

“If you'll lend me the Porsche. | have an idea Lieu-
tenant Dimmock may have one of his boys keeping
an eye on my car.’

“Why don’t you let me drive you?”

“I'd like nothing better, Sib. But we'll have to
postpone it. You're needed at the store. Alice will be
doing nipups trying to cope with those cops. How
about giving her a buzz now? See if you can find out
how Baisha Gates made out with Dimmock”

“All right.” Sibyl followed him into the cigar store
on the corner, left the door of the phone booth open
so he could hear.

“Protection Office, please ... Hello, Becky? ...
Can you speak freely? Or is that sergeant still in
your hair? ... Oh, he has ... Yes? ... Yes? ... And the
other one? ... No! ... With Miss Gates? ... I'll tell him
... How's Al making out? ... | can believe it. ... Short-
handed is right. ... No, he won't. ... Yes, | will ... Half
hour orso....Of course... .'By”

She pushed the door wide open, stayed on the
shelf seat. “They've relaxed the watch on the Rhine.
The lieutenant’s still with Miss Gates in Mister
Grolheim’s office; they've been in a huddle for three
quarters of an hour, already.”

“Don't like that”

“No. But Baisha's not the only one having her
troubles. Al's standing on her head. Mister Stolz is
raising the roof because he can’t get in touch with
you. More calls from the aisles than you and | and
Press usually handle. Two detainees in the Interview
Spencer Dean 167

Room right now. And that Homicide sergeant has
been taking all the calls at Becky's phone, upto a
few minutes ago.”

“Then what?”

“Becky doesn’t know. Someone called in. Quin-
ton asked some questions. Among other things he
asked ‘Hotel Herford?” —then after a bit he hung up,
grabbed his hat, and left”

“Hm. | like that even less. Wonder who was tele-
phoning him about my hotel?”

“Becky thought it was a woman calling” Sibyl
dropped a dime in the slot, dialed her garage. “Could
it have been Ruth Preston?”

“Doubt it”

“She rang you there last night”

“Sure, but she'd be the last person to unburden
herself to anyone who might be a police officer. Ruth
knows our office routine; she'd recognize a strange
voice. No, it wouldn't have been Ruth.”

Sibyl spoke to the garage, left orders for the
sports car to be ready on the street, hung up.

Don said: “Chances are there's been a plain-
clothes man hanging around the Herford for a
couple of hours, hoping I'd show up. | don't want to
oblige the Homicide squad that much. But | can't
forget that Max took the key to my hotel room along
with all my clothes.”

She stared at him. “You think one of the others
may have gone to your room, planted something for
the police to pick up?”

“Afraid so”

“Then ... why don't | go there, beat the sergeant
to it?”
168 Murder On Delivery

He said: “I couldn't ask you to stick your neck out
like that”

“You didn't ask me. | volunteered”

“It’s a real risk, Sib. Whoever spotted me coming
out of My’s house this morning saw you with me.
Maybe the description of you wasn't sufficient for
Dimmock to recognize you. But there may have been
additional identification by now”

“Don't be silly. If there had been, Quinton would
have been asking Al or Becky a million questions
about me; he saw me walk out of your office this
morning. Let's get a move on.”

They caught a cab.

“How will | get in your room?”

“Give me one of your cards, your Protection
cards.” He scribbled on it. “Don’t go to the desk. At
the right as you go in the lobby is a little stand like a
minister's pulpit”

“The bell captain's station.”

“Right. Ask for Tommy. If he's not around, Hap.
Either one’ll get the key from the desk. Just give ‘em
this card”

“What'll | look for when | get in?”

He scowled blankly at the photograph of the
driver in the license frame. “No idea. My clothes, per-
haps; they'd be sort of stained; they might be used
to show I'd had a run-in with Max. Just have to use
your head. Of course, if there's anything around that
doesn't belong to me ... that'll be the plant”

“Do | hide whatever it is?”

“You couldn't hide anything in a hotel room from
a fellow like Quinton. He'd know all the places.

No. Bring it with you ... if you can.” He put his arm
Spencer Dean 169

around her shoulders. “l don't like this at all ... but |
can't figure any other way to work k. Of course this
idea of a plant may be wrong”

She squeezed the hand on her shoulder. “l won't
have much time. What if Quinton’s there before me?”

“Tommy or Hap will know. They don't miss a trick,
those bellhops. But once you're in the room you'll
have to hurry”

“Where'll you wait for me?”

“In the cab. Around the corner. On Fifty-sixth.”

The taxi stopped at the marquee with the giant
Herford in multicolored glass.

Don said: “I've been thinking. The plant might be
something of Grolheim’s. To tie me in with him.”

Sib hopped out. “l won't be long”

“Don't be. Good luck”

The cab rolled on around the corner.

Don smoked a cigarette, keeping an eye out for
the sergeant. The twin streams of pedestrians pour-
ing past the cab in opposite directions, crowding,
jostling, seemed like the leads that were turning
up in this mixed-up, multiple crime—robbery,
kidnapping, murder. The motives of the hijackers
were carrying them in one direction; they were in
it for what they could get out of it in cash; they had
been hired or, at least, tipped off to the possibility
of stealing the sables. But it seemed clear now that
someone had suggested the theft for purposes of his
or her own, purposes having nothing to do with the
loot, having much to do with jealousies and hatreds.

It shouldn't be difficult to round up Max's com-
panion, the man with the bulgy spaniel eyes and the
broken nose and the nasty smile. It certainly would
170

Murder On Delivery

be easy to bring Missus Chadbourne to book, now
her name, her description, and her profession were
known. All that was needed was the assurance that
Press and My were out of the hijackers’ hands ... the
rest was police routine.

But how about the instigator of the triple crime?
Who' was the original guilty party?

The pneumatic hammers began pounding with
venomous fury; he began to feel new aches from the
beating. He had an overpowering feeling that Sib
wasn't coming back to the cab, that the police were
landing her, questioning her ... when he should be
the one to undergo that ordeal.

He looked at his watch. Only seven minutes since
she'd hurried into the Herford lobby. His watch must
have stopped. No, still running.

Then he saw her. She was carrying his suitcase;
passers-by were showing astonishment at a pretty
girl lugging a suitcase.

He jumped out, took the valise.

“Any trouble, shug?” He helped her in.

“No; she said. “Tommy was fine. He went up with
me, stood guard outside in the corridor”

“What's in here?” He tapped the suitcase.

“An overcoat,’ she said. “It was under your bed.
All rolled up.”

“Grolheim’s?”

“No. It's an oxford gray. With black velvet lapels”

“Jim Preston's!” Don had seen it a thousand
times.

Sibyl nodded, leaned toward him, whispering—

“The collar is simply caked with blood!”
CHAPTER 26

OLD TOWN FARM

THE SPORTS CAR TOOK THE PARKWAY HILLS LIKE A
swallow, soaring and swooping. A freezing drizzle
glazed the windshield, coating the highway with
treacherous silver. Nevertheless, Don kept the
speedometer at sixty.

He was becoming steadily more gloomy at the
probable significance of Jim Preston's overcoat. It
could not have been, as he had thought for a while, a
warning that any further investigative activity might
endanger Press's life. For if that had been the pur-
pose of the plant, there would have been no point
in tipping off the Homicide sergeant to a search of
Don's room at the Herford. The only other possibility
was that someone was determined to connect Don
with the kidnapping.

The pattern was plain. Two of Ambletts’ men had
been in charge of the crown sable garment when
it had been snatched. Don had known about the
plans for its delivery. One of the hijackers had been
found murdered in the home of Ambletts’ buyer.

171
172 Murder On Delivery

Grolheim had made at least four phone calls which
might be interpreted as putting him in partnership
with the criminals. Don himself had been forced into
the unfortunate position of withholding important
information from the police. The implication of an
inside job, with Ambletts employees conniving at the
scheme, could scarcely be stronger. If the overcoat
had been found by Quinton it would have bolstered
the suspicions aroused when someone had recog-
nized Don at the time he left Grolheim’s house.

He decided that it had been Missus Chadbourne
who must have gone to his hotel room, equipped
with the key Max had taken. The other man, the
fellow with the broken nose and the bulgy spaniel
eyes, would most likely have had to keep watch over
Grolheim. Unless the original gang had been com-
posed of more than three, only the brunette would
have been available to plant the bloodstained over-
coat. Why had she run a risk like that? How could she
have dared to gamble that Don would not be in the
room? Or had she been prepared to bargain with him
if she had found him there?

The odds, he thought, were that if he had caught
her in the Herford, she would have tried to talk her
way out, relying on the fact that she had almost
certainly saved his life. There was even the remote
chance that she was ready to break with Broken
Nose, unable to stomach the assault on Press, the
murder of Max.

Perhaps she sensed that time was running out,
that she'd better get on the right side of the law as
fast as she could before she landed in a cell. Maybe
she had suggested to Quinton that she would turn
Spencer Dean 173

state's evidence, had given him the tip-off about the
planted overcoat as proof of her intentions.

You're trying to look at her actions in the best light
because you wouldn't be here now, rocketing out to
Greenwich, if she hadn't risked her own life to save
yours. Use some common sense! That plant meant she
was trying to put you in the middle. To make it look as
if you had slugged old Press!

All the way to the Connecticut state line he
brooded about his part in the ransom deal. If any-
thing should go wrong with the delivery of that fifty
thousand, it would be taken as convincing proof that
he was in cahoots with the kidnappers. And there
were a thousand ways in which it might go wrong.

There was only the slimmest hope that Sibyl
would be able to dig up enough information about
Missus Chadbourne in time to trace her before the
money had to be handed over. Sib would be up at
Sari Soeurs now, describing the brunette and the
mink, but even if the swanky store came through
with an address, it was far from likely that Missus
Chadbourne would be found there. Besides, the
probabilities were that the mink, too, had been
acquired from My Cousin.

It was after four when he cut off the highway,
raced over black-top roads to the estate section of
Old Town Point. A query to a rural mailman brought
the answer:

“Mister Rettjer’s place? Why, this is it, right here.
All this, here"—with a wide sweep of hand—“but the
entrance is half a mile along, on the right. Sign at the
gate says Old Town Farm—Registered Angus Cattle.
Y'can't miss it”
174

Murder On Delivery

Don drove on. Long white fences, fat black cattle
in still-green fescue, gray sheep moving slowly
against a brown hillside, a high ornamental iron gate
barring the winding drive. The gate was locked.

He parked, got out of the car. There was no gate
tender’s house, no bell to ring, no box-housed
telephone.

They don't seem to expect visitors. But you haven't
come this far to be balked by a gate.

He climbed over the fence beside the Angus
sign, slogged along the sleety gravel between bare-
limbed oaks and elms to a white Georgian house
with spruce and cedar guarding the tall columns, the
deep porch beneath the balcony. There were two
cars in a big garage, but no sign of life.

The brass knocker made a resounding clatter.

For a minute he thought he was going to be ignored;
then a butler gotten up in genuine British coun-
try-house style opened the door, regarded Don with
eyes like a halibut’s.

“Missus Rettjer?”

The butler’s eyes searched the driveway for the
conveyance which had brought the visitor. “The
house is not open, sir”

“I didn’t take the trouble of hiking in here to
look at the antiques,” Don said. “Tell Missus Rettjer
that Cadee of Ambletts wants to see her about her
daughter. Go on. Skip the protocol. Tell her”

“I... ah ... "the butler opened his mouth, closed
it. “You will excuse me ... "He shut the door also.

The sleet rattled against the whitewashed brick
and the storm windows; there was no other sound
for a good two minutes.
Spencer Dean 175

What do you do if they give you the complete brush-
off? Try the back door? Go in a second-story window?
Offer to poke that butler in the nose?

The door opened abruptly. “Missus Rettjer is
indisposed. But she will see you for one minute.”
Puffy lids closed over the halibut eyes. “If you will
come to the library...”

Helen Rettjer did not seem ill. She seemed
haughty and tense and bitter. She wore the tweed
skirt and a heatherish sweater; Don noticed with
surprise that her hair was a glossy chestnut, combed
back severely from a high forehead. It made her
look younger but heightened her expression of aris-
tocratic distaste. She remained standing beside a
cherry escritoire.

“I understand the reason for your wishing to see
my daughter, Mister Cadee. That is neither possible
nor desirable. Joyna is in a private sanitarium under
the care of our physician, Doctor Volney; she will be
there for a considerable time. | think it unnecessary
to add that she has hurt her father and mother far
more than she hurt your store. For that, of course,
| am ready to make full payment”—she touched an
open check book on the writing desk—"if you will tell
me the amount of the damages.”

Don shook his head. “I can't tell you what the
amount will be, Missus Rettjer. | didn't come here as
a collection agent. You will hear from our Accounting
Department on that. But there are other charges
much more serious than slashing merchandise.”

Missus Rettjer held up a hand imperiously. “My
daughter has been pronounced by thoroughly
competent psychiatrists as in no way mentally
176

responsible for her actions. The child has been
brought to the verge of a nervous collapse because
of a situation which your store helped to bring
about. No, no"— she fluttered her fingers—“don’t
contradict me. Ambletts was morally responsible for
a betrayal of one of its good customers—I've dealt
with you since | was married—in order to make a few
thousand by selling a fur coat to my husband's mis-
tress. Don't deny it; | know all about it; my daughter
knew all about it... she was driven half crazy by the
knowledge that her father was wiling to break up our
home on account of this cheap little actress. Joyna
knew your store was helping this tawdry affair along,
for a profit, by making up an extravagant crown
sable coat. In her childish way she attempted to pre-
vent her father from making a fool of himself. Failing
in that, she flew off the handle and tried to take her
resentment out on the goods on your counters. | cer-
tainly can’t condone her actions; still | don't blame
her in the least. | myself have considered taking
much more stringent action in the matter”

“Up to and including murder?” Don said.

She froze into a sort of cataleptic rigidity, abso-
lutely motionless except for the widening of her
eyes, the slight flaring of her nostrils. The patri-
cian features became rosy pink, deep red, almost
purplish.

“Murder?” Her lips formed the word but he could
not hear her until she said in a choked voice: “Who
was murdered?”
CHAPTER 27

MISS JOYNA RETTIJER

DON SAID, “THE GARMENT YOU BLAME MY STORE
for selling was stolen last night. One of the robbers
was found beaten to death in a house in New York
this morning”

Helen Rettjer put a hand on the escritoire to
steady herself, turned away so he could only see her
profile. Then she stepped around the desk, sank into
the chair behind it.

She didn't know that ... or else she’s putting on a
very good act. “The victim was a teenager named
Max Tillson, only a couple of years older than your
daughter. When the police find out that Miss Rettjer
slashed a lot of our merchandise because she was
sore at Ambletts for selling the coat to her father,
they'll be likely to inquire whether she knew this
dead boy. Whether she had put him up to hijacking
the coat”

“Joyna had nothing whatever to do with it, | can
assure you. Nothing.” She regained some of her
poise. “My daughter's resentment took a different

177
178 Murder On Delivery

course. To be absolutely frank, she did consider
inflicting an injury upon this oversexed creature with
whom her father is infatuated.” The apoplectic color
faded from the haughty features. “As a matter of
fact, last Sunday Joyna actually went to the studio
where this person rehearses, with the intention of
doing her bodily damage. Fortunately she didn’t
find the notorious woman, so no harm was done.
However, when | learned what Joyna had intended,

| immediately put her under Doctor Volney’s care
and tried to keep her here at home. But this morning
she managed to slip out and hitch a ride to the city.
So | had to rush in to the studio myself, to warn this
woman to beware of my daughter”

“I'm a store detective, Missus Rettjer, not a police-
man. I'm only, concerned about two of Ambletts’
men who were kidnapped last night while they were
delivering this coat. But if | were a cop, I'd wonder
if a girl with your daughter's tendency to violence
might not also have planned the hijacking, the
kidnapping.”

“No, no, no! My child has no unnatural tenden-
cies at all. She only meant to protect me, to prevent
her father from breaking up her home.” Her shoul-
ders sagged, her head bent forward, she sounded
whipped, defeated. “Nothing that happened was
my daughter’s fault. The blame rests entirely on
her father and on me. Though | will say in my own
defense that whatever | did was entirely for Joyna’s
sake, so she should not lose her inheritance in the
event of a separation between Norman and me”

“What did you do?”

She lifted the lid of the escritoire, reached into the
Spencer Dean 179

compartment beneath. “l didn’t actually do it myself.
There are things one prefers to pay others to do”

She brought out a typed sheet of paper.“l arranged
to have this woman put under surveillance so | might
be prepared with evidence of the extent to which she
would go to alienate my husband's affections ... not
that there has been any real affection between us for
along time’

“You hired a keyhole snooper?”

The corners of her mouth curved down. “I prefer
to say a reputable investigating agency, recom-
mended by my lawyers.”

“I know that kind of detective” He was purposely
caustic.

“It is my impression that all detectives are much
alike,” she retorted wearily. “In any event, this is one
of the later reports sent to me. It is dated November
sixth from Las Vegas, Nevada.” She read rapidly in a
taut voice:

“Operative learned last night from
conversation between subject of inves-
tigation and Mister R. that he is
having made for her a crown sable
coat worth in neighborhood of one
hundred thousand to be presented on
occasion of her birthday, November
twenty-first. Item is being made up
by Ambletts Fifth Avenue. Subject of
investigation protested she would
rather have hundred-dollar ring for
the proper finger than gift referred
to. Reply of Mister R. was blurred on
180 Murder On Delivery
tape by radio then turned on in room.”

She refolded the sheet, replaced it in the com-
partment, closed the lid.“l had no intention of
telling Joyna this, but the child came in my room
while | was telephoning. She found it and read it. It
nearly drove her crazy to discover that her father was
planning to leave me”

“What did you do after you learned about the
crown sables?”

“Nothing.” She lowered her eyes. “What could |
do? Make a scene in my husband’s office? Pull the
creature’s hair? All | wanted was to lead my own life
quietly here in my home ... to see to it that Joyna’s
future was not jeopardized. What do you think]
could have done?”

He eyed her steadily. “A wife who'd hire a snooper
to spy on another woman might not be above hiring
someone to steal a hundred-thousand-dollar gift
meant for the other woman.”

She didn't lift her head. “Draw whatever conclu-
sions you please about me. But be careful. If you
attempt to accuse my daughter of complicity in this
... this theft and kidnapping and murder ... you will
be wrong and you will be sorry”

“I'll be sorry if you're holding back any informa-
tion that might help us to get Ambletts’ men back
safe and sound”

“I must ask you to leave now.”

The butler was in the doorway instantly.

Don scowled at him, followed him to the front
door, strode across the porch, down the sleeted
driveway.
Spencer Dean 181

She was doing her damnedest to protect her
daughter. Rettjer had covered up for his wife, hand-
ing out all that hoopla about how disinterested she
was. Hadley’s hell-bent to shield his star, his bread
and butter. While the ones who really need protec-
tion are Jim Preston and My Grolheim. And time is
running out on the clock... .

He thought about Las Vegas, the private eye,
Missus Chadbourne. Maybe Broken Nose was some-
one she had picked up out there, a stick manina
gambling house, perhaps. Yet Max had been a local.

He had climbed the rail fence, had almost
reached the car before he saw the girl, huddled
down in the front seat.

“Hey,” Joyna called. “l thought you were never
coming”

“| thought you were in a booby hatch
somewhere”

“Don't be silly. Mother told you that. She's such a
liar. You've no idea the lies she tells.” She beckoned.
“| owe you an apology. Drive me to Greenwich while
| explain’

He opened the door, edged beneath the wheel,
was putting the key in the switch before he noticed
the blued muzzle peeping from under her raspber-
ry-colored raincoat

“Another stick-up?” he asked quietly.

“Far be it. This is to keep you from having me
arrested again. And don't fool yourself: it's loaded
and the safety’s off and | know how to use itand |
will if you don't behave.”

“I never make passes at a girl with a gun.”

She giggled. “You're cute. You're a bastard but
182

Murder On Delivery

you're cute.”

He started the sports car, got it rolling. “What
were you going to explain?”

Joyna sniggered again. “First of all, that you're
going to drive me in to New York, not Greenwich.”

“Your mother will have the troopers after you in
nothing flat”

“Sure. So we'll go over to the Post Road and in on
the Bronx River Parkway. They won't be looking for
me there ... and anyhow they don't know what kind
of car you're driving. Is this your car? It's cute”

“End of explanation?”

“No, there's more. But first | have to know what
lies mother told you.”

“That you were under a doctor’s care.”

“Hoh! She's the one who's a mental case. Not me.
| suppose she told you she didn’t know anything
about the present my father is giving that television
bitch”

“She read me a report from a private detective in
Las Vegas.”

“Did she tell you about the fight | had with my
father about Silly Inez?”

“No. When was that?”

“Last night. Outside the apartment house where
she lives”

“What time?”

“About half-past seven or so. Oh, | screamed and
carried on something frightful. But it didn't do any
good. He just told me | needed a good whaling...”

“He might have something there”

“Hoh! I'd like to see any man try it... unless |
wanted him to. Anyway, | couldn't stop my father
Spencer Dean 183

from going to her goddamn birthday party but | gave
her fair warning what I'd do if she wore that god-
damn coat”

“You gave her a number of warnings, didnt you?
Those jerk jingles?”

She squealed in delight. “How did you know?
Pretty cute, weren't they? Did Silly Inez show them
to you?”

“Yep!

“She didn't show you the best one, though. She
hasn't even heard it yet” Joyna chanted in a shrill
sing-song:

“You think you'll be dressed up to kill
But I'm the one who really will!

“How do you like that?”

“Kid stuff,” he said.

“Hoh! You think so? She won't think so. That's
what I'm going to recite to her just before | use this
gun on her tonight.”
CHAPTER 28

DELIVERED TO MISS INEZ

DON SWUNGTHE SPORTS CAR INTO THE STREAM OF
trucks and tractor trailers on the Post Road. It was
almost dark and much colder; the sleet had turned
to a hard, gritty snow. “Trouble with you is, you
haven't any more sense than to mean it”

“Why shouldn't | mean it!” Joyna cried. “I'm not
going to let that Silly Inez steal my father!”

“You won't see much of your father if you shoot
her. They'd put you where you couldn't skip out as
easily as you did from your home just now.”

“They wouldn't do much to me if I kill her”

“Think not?”

“I'd get off easy. They'd have to try me in Juvenile
Court; I'm underage. Those judges would be pigeons
for me” She put a sob in her voice. “l was brought
up in a broken home ... | did it to keep Mommy and
Daddy together”

“You were brought up spoiled rotten. You're
acting like this because you're not getting as much
attention as you'd like. Any judge would see through

184
Spencer Dean 185

your tantrums in a minute”

Joyna laughed. “That's what you think. I'd cry
and rave and fall off the stand in a faint. Besides,
my father can afford to hire the best psychiatrists to
prove I'm not morally responsible for my acts.” She
moaned piteously. “Everything went black... | don't
remember pulling the trigger”

“You're not going to pull any trigger”

“No? Hoh! Wait and see.” She slid away from him.
“Think you can get the gun away from me?”

“I'll let your father do that. I'm going to take you
to him.”

“Yeah?” She sneered skeptically. “Where?”

“At Miss Inez’ apartment.”

“No kidding! You mean that? Can you get in the
Buckinghurst? | couldnt. They even put me out of
the elevator when | tried to go up to tell her off’ She
was excited.

“I'll get you in, all right. Your father’s going to
meet me there at six”

“What for?”

“We have some business to discuss.”

“Is it about that goddamn coat?”

“That's right. You'd like to have those sables your-
self, wouldn't you?”

“No,” she snapped. “You think I'm envious of her.
Well, I am, but not about any lousy coat. Shows how
smart you aren't, you just don't understand me.
Nobody does, not even mother” She sulked, shrink-
ing as far away from him as possible.

He made no attempt at conversation. The sports
car crossed the bridge into Manhattan, sped down
the East Side expressway.
186 Murder On Delivery

Not until they had turned westward in a press of
early-evening traffic did Joyna speak again:

“You're trying to trick me.”

“Why should 17”

“Because you want to keep me away from Silly
Inez”

“I want to keep you from causing any more trou-
ble. If it hadn't been for you, a couple of my friends
wouldn't have been kidnapped last night.”

“I don't know what you're talking about.”

He braked down for a red light at Park Avenue.
“You know Max Tillson, don't you? Friend of yours,
wasn't he? Kid who got killed last night?”

“Oh!” She flung open the door at her side, sprang
out, leaped in front of a car just beginning to roll; the
light had changed. Half a dozen horns began honk-
ing impatiently.

Don reached over, closed the far door, let in the
clutch. He couldn't hop out and chase her, leaving
Sib’s car to block traffic. Even if he should corner the
girl, there was the gun to consider.

You should have taken the pistol away from her.
She believes all that guff she was giving you about
getting off easy if she uses that gun. She has no more
moral sense than a cobra.

But he couldn't decide whether or not she had
fled on account of his mention of Max Tillson. By
the time he parked at the Buckinghurst he was still
debating the possibility that she had spark-plugged
the series of crimes.

The big doorman, who had told him about Sally,
was on duty but the night super was not yet at the
desk. The day man phoned upstairs, gave him the
Spencer Dean 187

nod to the elevator.

Frances let him in. “Miss Inez is not here. But she
told me you were expected. Please make yourself
comfortable” She was polite but no more. “May |
bring you a drink?”

“Scotch, if you have some. On the rocks.” He
dropped into one of the low-slung chairs, thinking
how much more pleasant than this lush decor was
the warm coziness of Sibyl Forde’s place.

The crystal clock on the mantel said five minutes
to six.

When the maid brought the whisky, he said: “You
know a private eye has been keeping tabs on your
mistress and her admirer, Frances?”

“No.” She was startled. “| did not know this.”

“He knows all about the Las Vegas goings on. You
went to Nevada with Miss Inez?”

“But of course. | go everywhere she goes.’

“Remember meeting a woman name of
Chadbourne?”

“| don’t know anyone named Chadbourne”

He sampled the scotch. “No? Thought you might.
She was one of the gang that stole Miss Inez’ birth-
day present. I've been told Missus Chadbourne was
in Las Vegas same time you were!”

Frances tossed her head defiantly. “If you imagine
| gave this woman any information, you are crazy.
| keep my mouth shut. | talk to no one of Miss Inez.
And of this stealing, | know not one thing”

“You must have heard something out in the corri-
dor last night” He finished the liquor. “There'd have
been quite a commotion out there, a light. One man
was knocked out. And you were expecting someone
188 Murder On Delivery

to arrive just about then!”

“Yes. Miss Inez was.” She hesitated, then the
words tumbled out. “I will tell you, even if it costs me
my job—I will tell you the truth. | was in the dressing
room, hanging up some things.” She gestured. “The
dressing room is next the hall, what you call the
corridor. | hear a bump and a shout, then another
bump. | hurry to hang up the things | have, then | go
out to the kitchen and listen at the service door. It is
all quiet. | open the door and there is no one there.
No one. Nothing. | think it must be gremlins or my
imagination. But when | come back to the living
room to tell Miss Inez, there is Mister Richard.”

“Richard?”

“She calls him that so no one will know his name.
He has just come in from the other elevator. He is
explaining something to Miss Inez but he stops when
he sees me. His tie is untied, his collar is unbuttoned.
And there is blood on his chin”

A buzzer sounded. She ran to the foyer, opened
the door. “Good evening,” she said.

The phone rang. Don went to the gilded handset,
lifted it

A faraway voice said: “West Cornwall is calling
Mister Norman Rettjer. Is he there?”

Don said: “One minute. He's just come in”

He held out the instrument as Rettjer hurried
across the room.

“Hello? ... Yes, this is Rettjer speaking ... Oh yes,
Mister Grolheim, | can hear you plainly ... . Yes, |
have the exact amount in the denominations you
specified ... . Yes, yes, | understand ... to the studio
...and turnitoverto—?Hm....Very well ... . The
Spencer Dean 189

instructions shall be followed to the letter ... . Yes, |
will wait here for your later call” He hung up, a puz-
zled scowl creasing his forehead.

Don said: “You timed that nicely”

“I was delayed,” Rettjer said shortly. “That was
your man Grolheim. | must say that if he is acting as
an unwilling go-between, he manages to conceal his
reluctance remarkably well”

“The money is to be taken to the television
studio?”

“I can't fathom it" Rettjer shook his head, baffled.
“It's to be delivered to Miss Inez”
CHAPTER 29

PAINTING THE TOWN

DON SAID: “SHE'S AT THE STUDIO NOW?”

“Rehearsal, yes. Show's all balled up. She wasn't
there this morning or this afternoon. Hell of a mess.”
Rettjer gazed speculatively at the maid, who was
waiting by the door to the dining room. “Frances,
bring me some coffee-cognac, will you please?”

She left.

The financier paced the floor. “This is a contin-
gency for which I'll have to admit | am completely
unprepared. To have this bunch of bandits ask for
the ransom to be delivered to Miss Inez”

“It’s all of a piece,” Don said. “Cut from the same
cloth as the phone call from Grolheim. Scheme is to
make it seem as if Lily Inez is in on the steal, in on
the deal. You can't believe she’s mixed up in it. Well, |
refuse to concede that any Ambletts man is”

“You may be right, Cadee. I'll go along with that.
But | have an uncomfortable feeling that someone is
making a fool of me. It’s a sensation | don’t enjoy.”

“Now you know how | felt when you told me, in

190
Spencer Dean 191

your office, that Missus Rettjer wasn't sufficiently
interested in you to raise a fuss. I've just come from
your Greenwich place, where | learned she’s by no
means as disinterested as you led me to believe”

“Ah! Rettjer stopped pacing. “Trouble?”

“Court trouble, perhaps,” Don said. “Not the kind
my friends face from the crew that hijacked the
sables. Where's the fifty thousand?”

“Brief case is on the table in the foyer there,
Rettjer pointed. “You're to hand it to her, ask no
questions.”

“It won't be that simple.” Don went to the foyer,
was surprised at how heavy the cowhide brief case
was.

“Now I'm sorry | agreed to let you make the con-
tact. I'd like to hand over the money myself. Just to
see...”

“Too late to change your mind. I'm on my way.’
Don went out and down.

He had been as much astonished at Grolheim’s
instructions as Rettjer. It wasn't possible that the
star was interested in the ransom. Her weekly
income from records, endorsements, movies, guest
appearances, Painting the Town itself... would easily
top the fifty thousand which hefted so heavily in the
brief case. “Hand it to her, ask no questions” What
could it mean other than that the kidnappers had
already been in touch with her, told her what to do
with the money. The only possible conclusion was
that she must know at least one of the kidnappers.
That, accordingly, she could be trusted to deliver
the funds without betraying them. In which case,
certainly she must have suspected the identity of
192 Murder On Delivery

the criminals right from the time of the hijacking
last night. Yet she'd kept her suspicions to herself, in
spite of the lethal danger to Press, to Grolheim. No
doubt this was what had passed through Rettjer’s
mind too.

Don drove to Telecast Towers, turned the car over
to an attendant in the underground parking lot,
lugged the brief case up to the eighth floor.

Strictly up to you now, boy. You asked for this job.
A lot depends on keeping your eye on the ball. A lot?
Lives!

The studio blazed with lights, buzzed with activ-
ity. Actors in costume and make-up crowded behind
and beside the sets. The orchestra leader in full dress
flicked his baton at pink-uniformed musicians; a
wave of melody surged through the great hall.

Lily Inez sang a Showboat tune with the proper
air of melancholy. Dressed as a dance-hall girl of the
Gay Nineties, she leaned against an old-time bar, the
sultry voice low and clear over the muted brass.

Don spoke softly to a dancer in harlequin:
“Where'll | find Elton Hadley?”

The dancer pointed to a huge glass panel in the
studio wall. “Control room.”

If the star saw him, Don couldn't tell. Though he
passed within twenty feet of her, her voice never
faltered. But the manager had seen him. By the time
Don reached the door marked: do not open this door
when red light is on, there was a sudden movement
behind that glass panel.

He opened the door. Hadley was coming out of
the control room.

“Important package for Miss Inez” Don held up
Spencer Dean 193

the brief case. “Have to give it to her right away.”

“She’ll be through the number in a minute. But |
don't like—"

“This is urgent. Get me to her”

Hadley said: “What is it?”

“Something from Rettjer. She'll know what it is”

“Okay. We can slip around to the dressing-room
entrance...”

Don followed him. “Can anyone barge in here, get
to see the members of the cast?”

“Not supposed to. But in rehearsal nobody both-
ers much’

“You better bother. To watch out for Rettjer’s
daughter”

“My God! Joyna loose again?”

“With a gun?”

“Jesus! Where is she?”

“She said she was coming here, tonight.”

“That's all we need,” the manager groaned. “That
whacky brat, blood in her eye”

“| didn't see her in the studio. But | could have
missed her, all those people.”

“We'll have to warn the ushers” Hadley mopped
perspiration off his high forehead. “There. Lil's fin-
ished now. Come on”

A tide of dancers, in turkey-gobbler costume,
swept past them. Two property men maneuvered a
pumpkin chariot in their path. Lily Inez saw Hadley,
clapped a hand to her ears in dumb show as she
came toward him.

“I murdered that one,” she cried, then recognized
Don, “Oh... you”

He nodded. “With a special packet for you.” He
194 Murder On Delivery

held oat the brief case.

She took it, nearly dropped it. “Why, it’s heavy.’

Hadley reached out to take the burden.

“No! She clung to the leather handle. “I'll keep
it”

Don said: “You know what it is?”

“Yes!” She didn't look at him. “Excuse me ... “She
walked rapidly away, calling ... “I'll be back for the
apple-bobbing number, Elton.”

Don followed her as quickly as he could, dodging
around scenery, cameras, actors.

She hurried down a corridor, turned a corner,
disappeared.

He was only a few yards behind her. But when
he reached the corner, she was vanishing through a
door.

It was labeled: WOMEN.

Well, hell, you can't trail her in there. But you can
wait until she comes out with the brief case. Or until
some other female does. What an idea for a ransom
drop! A man-proof meeting place.

He waited, thinking of the brunette in the
turquoise gown. Only in all probability Missus Chad-
bourne wouldn't be wearing the same gown two
nights in succession.

Girls came out, girls went in. Some of them eyed
him curiously, but he didn't dare move around the
comer for fear of missing the all-important contact.

But he flattened himself against the wall, trying to
make himself look as inconspicuous as possible. In
that position he could see both up and down the hall
leading to the lavatory.

He had only been there a minute when, out of
Spencer Dean 195

the comer of his eye, he saw a raspberry-colored
raincoat.

He turned his back swiftly, hoping she hadn't seen
him, but half expecting a bullet in die back.

As she came past him, he grabbed her.

She screeched, spun around, clawing at his face.

The raincoat ripped. She tore away, ran wildly
back up the hall, the pistol swinging in her right
hand. She gained the corner, rounded it.

He sprinted after her.
CHAPTER 30

A LATE-MODEL PONTIAC

MEMBERS OF THE PAINTING THE TOWN CAST CAME
swarming out of a studio exit, surrounding Joyna,
blocking her way, pinning her against the wall. She
squealed, brandished the pistol.

They laughed at her, considering it horseplay,
supposing the gun to be a prop pistol. They kidded
her. One of the harlequins made a playful pass at
her.

Don closed in. She tried to get room to raise the
automatic.

He seized her arm, twisting it until she screeched,
dropped the weapon. He bent to pick it up. She
stamped on his hand but he got the gun, put more
pressure on her wrist until she whimpered.

“Let me go,” she moaned. “You're breaking my
arm.”

“I'm saving your life, you little lunatic He turned
her around, brought her wrist behind her back.

Hadley’s imposing head loomed above the crowd.
“Got her?”

196
Spencer Dean 197

“For the moment,” he said morosely. “Got the
popgun, which is more important. Here ... Miss
Rettjer’s all yours.”

Hadley was pale, sweating, shaken. “What the hell
can | do with her?”

Joyna spat at him. “You'll let me go, that’s what
you'll do. Or I'll get my father to throw you out of this
studio.” She fought to get free.

“Shut up, brat.” Don motioned to the manager.
“Grab her other hand before she claws your eyes
out. If | were you I'd get a couple of your advertising
agency men to help you cart her back to Miss Inez’
apartment. Her father’s there. Turn her over to him.”

Joyna kicked Don in the shin. “What do you think
my father can do with me, you bastard! I'll burn
down the goddamn apartment house.”

Don thumbed on the safety, held out the pistol to
Hadley. “You better take this. Just to show how far
off her rocker she is”

Hadley took the gun reluctantly. “Did she really
try to shoot Lil?”

“She was on her way. | cut her off” Don released
Joyna’s wrist. “You're on your own with her, Hadley.
| have to get hold of your star” He moved away as
Joyna flailed at him ineffectually, snarling and kick-
ing at Hadley simultaneously.

Hadley called: “Tell Lil ... “ The rest was drowned
in Joyna's shrieks of rage.

Don hurried back to his post by WOMEN.

A file of females crowded in past him, others
came out in groups of two and three. No dance-hall
costume among them./But ... was one of them the
kidnaper's contact girl?
198

Murder On Delivery

He spoke to a couple of emerging dancers in
cancan skirts and petticoats. “Is Miss Inez in there?”

They looked blank. “Oh no ... she has her own pri-
vate dressing room and lavatory. She's not in there,
I'm sure.”

You muffed it. Because of that juvenile hellcat. You
gambled on making the contact so you could make a
deal for Jim Preston, My Grolheim. You lost, lost time
the cops might have used to round up the kidnappers
if you hadn't tried to lone-wolf it. Now what do you
do?

He remained on watch a moment longer, hoping
for a glimpse of Missus Chadbourne. Then he went
back to the studio. The rehearsal had stopped. The
musicians were “taking ten.” Neither Hadley nor his
charge were around. Lily Inez was not there.

You're not supposed to ask her any questions, but
the hell with that, now. You'll put it up to her straight,
tell who you gave that brief case to ... or talk to the
police.

But he couldn't find her. Nobody had seen her
since the finish of the Showboat number. Nor was
anyone sure when the rehearsal would be resumed.

He went down to the garage, turned in his car
check. There was one slim hope left ... in half an hour
the hijackers were supposed to notify Rettjer where
the sables would be returned. That was the last
chance of making contact with them.

He realized that now they had the cash, the
danger to My and Press was much greater. If the
kidnappers’ intention was to frame Grolheim for
an inside job, the groundwork had been well done.
What grand jury would fail to indict after hearing
Spencer Dean 199

Morrie Berkowsky's testimony about the phone call
from Grolheim, Norman Rettjer’s story about the
talks he'd had with the fur buyer?

If Grolheim could be accused of connivance, why
not Press? Why not Ambletts’ Chief of Protection,
too?

It's all of a piece, cut from the same cloth. That's
what you told Rettjer. Now if they follow that pattern,
where will they have the crown sable coat returned?
Why, somewhere that would add to the suspicion of
an inside job.

Not My’s house; there would be police on guard;
the kidnappers would know that. Not Rettjer’s, that
wouldn't have any Ambletts connotation. Neither
would the Buckinghurst. There were police on watch
at the Herford, too ... so even if that might be the
contact spot, it wouldn't help to go there. Besides,
they tried that overcoat “plant”; they wouldn't
return the sables there too.

Jim Preston's! That might accomplish the tie-up
they were after. He considered it carefully. That
would be according to pattern, all right.

His car came. He cut across town, drove down to
the Brooklyn Bridge, headed for Flatbush.

Maybe he was wrong, coming all the hellangone
out here, solely on the basis of his reasoned conclu-
sion as to what the kidnappers might do with the
crown sable coat. There was one last ditch alterna-
tive—My Grolheim had phoned from West Cornwall,
Connecticut.

It was probable that Broken Nose had been there
with him, that immediately after the call Grolheim
would have been led back to some hide-out nearby.
200 Murder On Delivery

But what were the chances of locating that hide-out,
with no more to go on than the description of the
two men? It might take weeks to search the sur-
rounding country. All that was left were minutes.

It was five past seven by the dashboard clock
when he ran the sports car into the driveway of the
two-family house where the Prestons lived.

There were lights on the far side of the house,
where Jim lived; the nearer half was dark.

He rang the doorbell over the James N. Preston
plate.

Sibyl opened the door. “Don! | thought you'd be
... prisoner by now.’

“Scheme backfired. How's Ruth?”

“Low in the mind. She asked me to come and stay
with her, after the store closed. | told her what you
were planning to do. She's lying down.”

He told her about the call from West Cornwall,
the trip to the studio, the transfer of the brief case
to Lily Inez, about Joyna and Hadley and the missed
contact “Only other thing is to grab the party who's
to turn over the coat, if that’s possible” He went
to the phone, rang the number on Lily Inez* gilded
handset.

Ruth Preston came into the living room as he
dialed. She put her arms around him and wept. Don
was as big brotherly as possible, until Rettjer came
on the line.

The financier was brief and bellicose. “Can't talk
long. My daughter's here. So are Hadley and Miss
Inez. This place is a madhouse.”

“What about Grolheim? Did he call you again?”

“No. Lady did. Said the item in question would
Spencer Dean

be delivered at the home of a Mister Preston, 241 La
Verne Place, Flatbush. That's your friend, isn't it? The
one who couldn't have had anything to do with this
business?”

“That's right. You want to make a bet, I'll give you
any odds you like this wasn't any of his doing.’

“I'm just telling you..."

“Thanks. I'm at Preston's now.” Don hung up.

You hit it sock on the nose for once. Now ... if it
isn't too late ...

He got away from Ruth. “I'm going outside. The
coat is supposed to be delivered here. Maybe it has
been, already. But if not—" He went to the front
door.

Coming slowly along the street was a green and
brown station wagon. A late-model Pontiac.

201
CHAPTER 31

A BLINDING FLASH

“THAT'S GROLHEIM'S STATION WAGON." HE DREW
back from the curtained glass of the front door. “Girl
driving. She's going on past the house. Probably
circling the block as a precaution to make sure
there's no police trap”

Sibyl said: “Was it Missus Chadbourne?”“Couldn’t
see” He opened the door. “But she might have seen
me. Can't tell. 'm ducking across the street. If she
hasn't been frightened away, she may come back
with the sables.”

Ruth caught his arm. “Maybe Jim's in that car!”

“Didn't see a man, Ruth.” Don patted her hand,
disengaged himself. “But if he isn't, | may be able
to make the girl drive me to where they're holding
Press” He ran.

Sibyl cried: “I'm going to follow you. In my car” He
called: “No, no! You might upset the applecart. Close
that door.” He gained the shelter of shrubbery beside
the house across the street. The door of the Preston
home closed.

202
Spencer Dean

Down the block, headlights swung into view,
moved toward him. The Pontiac slowed, stopped.
The car lights went off. The motor kept purring.

The Chadbourne woman got out. She wore the
mink but over her arm she carried the Lily Inez.
There was no mistaking those crown sables even
under the faint light of the street lamp a hundred
feet away.

She crossed the street, hesitated at the Preston
porch, turned away, hurried around the side of the
house.

Don crept to the side of the station wagon,
waited, crouching.

Missus Chadbourne hurried to the sports car,
tossed the sables in the front seat, ran back to the
Pontiac, jerked open the front door, jumped in.

Don had the door on his side open before she
could put on the lights. He slid in beside her.

She gasped.

He held his old .45 so the faint light glinted on the
barrel. “Sorry to have missed you at my hotel, Missus
Chadbourne. You're getting to be quite a coatroom
girl”

Her voice trembled. “I put the sables ... in the little
car ... across the street ... as was agreed. What more
do you want?”

“There was another point in the agreement.
Where are the men you abducted?”

“They'll be back later”

“Sorry not to take your word for that. Have to
make sure of it. Get this wagon rolling. Ought to
make it out West Cornwall way in an hour and a
half”

203
204 Murder On Delivery

She switched on the lights, pulled away from the
curb.

He looked behind him in the second seats, on
the floor. “What'd you do with the boodle? The brief
case?”

She ignored the question. “If you make me drive
you to Mister Grolheim you'll get me killed; maybe
you don't realize that”

“I haven't forgotten you saved my life this morn-
ing. I'll try to return the compliment. You don't think
My Grolheim would hurt you?”

“He killed Max. In self-defense, but still—"

“Did you see this yourself?”

“No. But Arny told me. And Mister Grolheim didn't
contradict him. So you see—"

Arny? Arnold Broken Nose? “Didn't Arny get sore at
having his side-kick beaten to death?”

“Of course not. Max was a menace to all of us. We
didn’t know he used H ... . When he had a load on,
he was a fiend. Mister Grolheim never suspected Max
would be coked up last night, that’s what started
all the trouble. Max went berserk, beat your friend
Preston over the head. Arny and Mister Grolheim had
agreed there wasn't to be any violence—"

“Trying to blame it on Grolheim? To make it look
as if he was in on it with you?”

“Why, he was. It was his idea to begin with. But
when Max flew off the handle and began to act like a
raving maniac, Mister Grolheim wanted to back out.
The original plan was to have me fly the coat out to
Buenos Aires and sell it there. But after Mister Pres-
ton was hurt so badly—"

“Is he still alive?”
Spencer Dean 205

“I don’t know.” She drove in silence for a bit. “I ...
don't think so,” she added in a low voice.

So much for all their lying promises! For your keep-
ing Ruth's hopes alive. Old Press is dead ... and they
mean to make it look as if Grolheim is guilty along
with Max and Broken Nose. You may not be able to
bring Press back home but you can still clear My, bring
the others to book.

She switched on the defroster; the snow had
turned to freezing rain once more. “When Mister
Grolheim found out that Max had nearly killed you,
there at his house, it nearly drove him out of his
mind ... Mister Grolheim, | mean.”

“| can believe that” My’s been practically out of his
mind for the past twenty-four hours, but not because
he’s been on a diet of heroin. “Even if | don’t buy that
business about his beating Max's brains out Who
took the body back to Grolheim’s ... and why?”

“I took it back.”

“You hauled that dead weight into the kitchen by
yourself?”

“Yes. You don't think I'm strong enough?”

| think you lie. You had help, must have had. From
the guy who came back from Las Vegas with you. “I'll
tell you what | think, Missus Chadbourne. | believe
you when you say no violence was intended; | sup-
pose Arny’s plans had to be switched on the spur
of the moment after Max ran amuck. But | don't go
for that business about My Grolheim’s having been
in on the scheme from the beginning. You wouldn't
have taken the body back to his house unless you'd
wanted to make it look as if he was mixed up init...
when actually he was the innocent bystander”
206 Murder On Delivery

“Aren't you overlooking all those telephone calls?
Would he have made those unless—"

“I think he might have. Under certain circum-
stances.” He watched a pair of low-to-the-ground
headlights trailing along behind. Had Sibyl stuck her
neck out and followed in the sports car?

No ... at the last light before the bridge to Manhat-
tan, the lights drew nearer, pulled ahead. It was a red
Jaguar, driven by a youth in motorcycle goggles and
a black leather jacket.

He went on. “Contradict me if 'm wrong ... but
I'd say the whole setup got out of hand after Max
slugged Jim Preston at the Buckinghurst. Arny had
to improvise to protect himself and cover up for you.
The kidnapping was an afterthought. And the cir-
cumstances | just spoke of, somebody thought those
up right off the top of his head.”

She drove across Chambers, saying nothing.

He twisted around to look behind at the Broad-
way stop light. No sign of a sports car. He felt
relieved. “Then when Max clobbered me and you
told your pal about that, he lost his head. He may
have acted in self-defense, as you said Grolheim did.
But whether it was manslaughter or murder, your
chum killed Max. And he helped you carry the body
to My’s kitchen because, by then, you were all sure
your only chance of avoiding prosecution was to lay
the blame on My’s shoulders.”

The station wagon climbed the ramp, joined
the trickle of traffic moving northward on the
expressway.

Missus Chadbourne said suddenly: “You know so
goddamn much about it, what's the use of my trying
Spencer Dean 207

to tell you the truth?”

“Might be a novel experience. Might try it ... just
for kicks. And maybe to save your own skin.”

“Go to hell” She sulked, refusing to say another
syllable.

The storm grew worse. Rain lashed against the
windshield. The highway became a sheet of glare
ice. Whitecaps showed against the dark mirror of the
Hudson. At the parkway toll gates by Spuyten Duyvil
the policeman stepped out of his booth, came close
to the car on her side.

Is he checking on that alarm Dimmock must have
sent out? Man with prematurely white hair, a white
mustache, a banged-up face?

But the cop said only: “Take it easy, folks. Road's
slippery as greased glass.”

Don leaned across her to pay the toll. “We’ll watch
it, officer”

Later she said: “l could have turned you in then.”

“Not without turning yourself in, too.”

The clock on the dash said eight, eight-fifteen,
eight-thirty. There was no more conversation. Don
was glad of the stinging rain, the bitter cold; it kept
him awake ... and the sucking of the tires on the wet
ice was making him unutterably sleepy.

For just a moment, after they had crossed the
Connecticut line, he dozed off.

Awoke to the sickening sensation of a skid.

The station wagon was slipping sidewise down a
long hill with a curve at the bottom, a white culvert.

He had a split-second picture of Missus Chad-
bourne, with clenched teeth and contorted face,
fighting the wheel.
208 Murder On Delivery

Then a spinning, a shock which slammed him
headfirst into the windshield, pain dissolving in a
blinding flash of light.
CHAPTER 32

TOO MANY IN THE KNOW

THE SOFT GLOW FROM A PINK LAMPSHADE SPILLED
claret over a white candlewick spread. It took Don a
while, after opening his eyes, to realize that the winy
light made the fingers of his left hand appear bloody.

He wriggled his fingers. They were caked with
blood.

It came back to him slowly. The lurching skid. The
sickening spin. Throwing his hand up to protect his
eyes. The crash.

He felt as if he ought to be in a hospital. But this
was no private ward. Venetian blinds, television set,
a door with a white Regulations card tacked to it, a
wheat-colored writing table. On the table was a cow-
hide brief case. Rettjer’s brief case.

“Don't tell me,” growled an unpleasant voice,

“you didn't fracture y’ freakin’ skull! We were just
getting ready to report you as an accident fatality.”

Turning his neck brought a sharp pain, but Don
twisted around enough to see a bony fist with a
sapphire ring as large as brass knuckles. His eyes

209
210 Murder On Delivery

traveled up to the stub of cigar drooping from a
smirking mouth, the broken nose, the bulgy brown
eyes. Arny.

“Been better if you'd cracked up permanently,
Cadee. Saved everybody a mess of trouble” The
man on the other bed flourished a gun for emphasis.
Don's .45.

“Pleasure to disappoint you,” Don muttered.

“It won't be any pleasure,” Arny answered. “We'll
just have to finish what that bang against the wind-
shield started. No other way now.’

“Sure” Don shifted painfully to raise on one
elbow. “I can tell you a better way”

“No. We had it all set” The reflection from the
claret light glinted on the gun, on that star sapphire.
“The big boy's paid off; he can afford it. Lily the Dilly
gets her coat back, all she wants. Max got what he
deserved, who can kick? Nobody else gets smeared,
nobody gets hurt”

“Nobody but me,” Don said dourly. “Nobody but
Jim Preston. And his wife. And My Grolheim.”

“Not our fault your buddy got slugged. Sorry
about his wife, but she’s responsible for the fix
you're in. She promised you'd keep hands off. You
had to stick your chin out. So... “

Don managed to prop himself up against the
headboard. “| stuck it out to give you a break. To
show you a way out.”

“There isn't any. I'm a two-time loser already.
They framed me for jumping a whisky truck. So any
rap from here in is the big rap for me. Before | let any
judge belt me with the book, I'll belt anybody who
can swear me in for life. That's you.”
Spencer Dean 211

“And Grolheim?”

“Nah. If there's any question of extortion, he did
all the dirty work.”

“Under a gun. Or under—"

“Horse. He's lost most of his marbles. He wanted
to keep the crummy sables himself, just to look at.”

The door opened. Missus Chadbourne came in.
She wore a suede suit, powder gray, smartly tailored;
she seemed pleased to see Don sitting up. “Your
head must be made of rock, mister.”

Arny said: “I'd rather break that kind of rock once,
quick, than spend the rest of my life on a rockpile
with a sledge. We can't set this store dick loose like
Grolheim?”

Don rubbed the back of his hand on the candle-
wick. “It won't settle anything to fix my wagon. Too
many are in on the know. Rettjer knows the money
went to somebody Miss Inez knew well enough not
to give away. Several people knew Missus Chad-
bourne was in Las Vegas at the same time Miss Inez
was. The police know Max had been a truck-jumper,
that most likely he'd have been working with some-
one he met in that line. The old bird on the service
elevator at the Buckinghurst has given a good
description of you, Arny. My office knows | came out
to Connecticut tonight. If you knock me in the head,
it'll only be one more step toward that chair you
never get up out of, on your own.”

“He's so right, Arny,” she said earnestly.

“He's a slick talker, Gretchen.” Arny smiled, but
there was nothing agreeable about it. “We can't fall
for that guff. Once he got in court he'd change his
tune. He wants to get even for his buddy”
212 Murder On Delivery

Don kept anger out of his voice. “| can’t do any-
thing for Jim Preston now. But I'll make a bargain
with you. Let My Grolheim go. You say you're not
afraid he might testify against you. Give him the keys
to his station wagon, turn him loose.”

Arny asked: “What's your side of the bargain?”

“I'll show you how you can get out of a jam with
no more than a slap on the wrist. If you don’t think
it will work, you can do what you want with me ... so
you're not taking any chance.”

Gretchen Chadbourne cried: “Arny! Take him up
on it! What can we lose?”

Arny said: “Let's have this allagazam—we're-in-
the-clear dope first”

“No; Don said. “Let My go, first. And let me talk to
him. To make sure he’s all right.”

“He's not.” Arny hefted the gun by the barrel
as if weighing its usefulness as a club. “I told you.
He's gaga. I'll show you. Bring the whack in here,
Gretchen”

She hurried out.

Arny said: “You can give out now, Cadee. She
don’t have to know.”

“For my deal she does. She saved my life once. |
told her I'd try to return the compliment. | mean to,
if | can. If you bop me with that gun, you'll both be
dead ducks. | don't happen to think she’s guilty of
much beyond agreeing to do a favor for a friend”

She returned, pushing Grolheim before her.

The fur buyer’s eyes were bright but his skin was
sallow, his facial muscles were relaxed as if he'd just
wakened. He walked slowly, stepping carefully as
if his feet were sinking into deep muck. “Well, of all
Spencer Dean 213

people,” he said cheerfully. “I certainly am glad to
see you, Don’

He didn't mention the blood on your face, your
hand. Maybe he thinks it all came from that beating
Max gave you. “They treat you okay, My?”

“No complaints.” Grolheim sat down on the other
end of the bed from Arny. “I'm a little tired of ham-
burg sandwiches, though.” He closed his eyes as if
exhausted.

Arny said: “We got the dough. It’s over there on
the desk. I'll give you your share in a minute”

“No hurry.” Grolheim flapped a hand up negli-
gently. “No rush. I'm not worried about the money.
Everything's all right, now Don's here”

Missus Chadbourne beamed: “You see, Mister
Cadee?”

Don said: “Everything's not all right with Jim Pres-
ton, is it, My?”

The fur buyer roused himself as if from a day-
dream. He shook his head like a dog coming out of
the water. “No,” he said more loudly. “Of course it
isn't, Don.” His shoulders straightened. “They killed
Preston, you know that? They murdered him in cold
blood. They'll have to pay for that, won't they, Don?”

Arny spoke savagely. “You'll pay, you weasly son
of a bitch. Take him back, Gretchen. They'll both pay
now. This one goes first!”

She cried: “No, no more, Arny! Don't! You'll ...
you'll have to kill me, too, if you do it. | won't stand
for it—I won't—| won't—"

Strong light filtered in through the Venetians.

“Shut up,” Arny whispered. “Car outside. Stopping
here!” He crept to the window, lifted a slat, peered
214 Murder On Delivery

out.
Don slid his feet over the side of the bed.
Sib, he thought She followed us somehow!
