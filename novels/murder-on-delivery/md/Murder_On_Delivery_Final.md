**YOUR LAST CHANCE–**

**THE AT TENDANT ATTHETOLLGATE PUNCHED HIS**

register, held out a handful of change. ﬁLittle colder
tonight.ﬂ
ﬁ Yeah.ﬂ The driver slid the station wagon away.
The man in the middle seat blinked at stinging
sweat tr ickling o˜ his eyebrows. He resisted the
impulse to reach for his handkerchief ; the watch
-
ful teenager at his r ight might misinter pret the
movement.
That was your last chance
, the man told himself
bitter ly.
You™ll never have another. Never in this life.
All he™d have had to do was cr y out.
Help!
Or
K idnap!
That would have done it.The driver might
have made a fast getaway, but the attendant would
have noti˚ed the state troopers; the chase would
have been on.
Yet he™d lacked the nerve Šjust as he™d not been
able to summon up the courage to ˛ing open the
door and dive out onto the highway at that stop light
6
a few miles back.That couple in the other car across
the street would surely have seen him, would have
come to his aid.
But fear of his captors had paralyzed him abso
-
lutely ; he was the helpless rabbit staring, fascinated,
at the beady eyes of the snake. Knowing what the
end would be, yet powerless to prevent it.
I t was not because they had actually threatened
him. What had dropped back there in Buck inghurstŠ
that had been more e˜ec tive than any spoken
threat.What had half hypnotized him had been their
matter- of-fact brutality and ruthlessness.
There was also the numbing recognition of the
inference to be drawn from the fact that his abduc
-
tors had made not the slightest e˜or t to keep him
from seeing where they were tak ing him. Evidently
they were not wor r ying about what he might say,
later.
The headlights funneled down a dar k , grove-
guarded slope, ˛ashed past a white barn and a
far mhouse, touched the pale cement of a creek
br idge, bored on through the pine-shadowed gloom
of the nex t r ise.
He k new these Ber kshire foothills well; this was
the way he™d dr iven to the Tanglewood festival only
a few months ago. But he could think of no reason
for them to be br inging him up into these lonely hills
in November.
ﬁI f you™re going to k ill meŠﬂ he began, shocked at
the harsh queerness of his voice.
The dr iver laughed tolerantly.ﬁD on™t be silly. K ill
you?We need you in our business.ﬂ
The youth beside him, the teenager with the eyes
7
that looked like peeled grapes, added: ﬁ You want to
look at it this way, doc.We™re taking you into par t
-
nership. You could make a sensational score outa
this.ﬂ
The man felt the muscles of his throat constric t.
Par tners with this cold-blooded pair? He knew what
that meant: it was only a question of time before the
par tnership would be abruptly ended with bludgeon
or bullet.Yet until that time came there was margin
for hope, even though slim. He would hold onto that
hope as long as he could; he would string it out as
long as possible.
ﬁAs businessmenﬂŠhe tr ied to keep the ter ror out
of his voice Šﬁ you k now you can™t ever sell it.ﬂ
The dr iver chuckled sof tly.ﬁ Tr y to get your mind
out of the conser vative channel, pard. We™re think ing
of a radical approach.ﬂ
ﬁBut how can you sell it?ﬂ the man asked.ﬁI t ™s the
only one of its kind in the wor ld.There™ll probably
never be another like it. I t ™s not like a diamond neck
-
lace; you can™t sell the skins separately.You can™t
dispose of it the way you might an old master ; it ™s
only valuable when the public sees it.ﬂ
ﬁ We heard,ﬂ the youth with the green- grape eyes
said a˜ably,ﬁit ™s worth a k ing™s ransom.ﬂ
ﬁI t is,ﬂ the man said bleakly.ﬁ There™s no way to
put price on it; it™s pr icelessŠbecause it can™t be
duplicated, now. Possibly never. ButŠﬂ
ﬁ That ™s all we want out of it,ﬂ the driver said over
his shoulder.ﬁ That ™s what you™re going to get us.ﬂ
The teenager sniggered. ﬁJust a good, average
k ing™s ransom – and if you play ball nice, we™ll cut
you in for a big, fat slice.ﬂ

The station wagon slowed at the crest of a hill.
The headlights swer ved to touch a low building
˛anked by two rows of blue cottages, holding in
br ight illumination:

## CHAPTER 2

**JIM HASN™ T COME HOME**

**THE TALL MAN WHO CAME THROUGH THE SWINGING**

doors from Lexington Avenue had the lean, keen
look of a marine, the prematurely white hair and
mustache of some distinguished diplomat. He had
been a marine; since then he had found himself
exercising what diplomac y he could muster as
Chief of Store Protec tion for Ambletts Fif th Avenue.
S ometimes, as on this particular day, he wondered
what an ex-leather neck was doing in a job that
called for lectur ing precocious pilferers, questioning
suspected employees, and sending shoplifters to the
House of Cor rec tion. But there were compensations;
this evening had been one of them.
The night clerk smiled a greeting, reached toward
the 1709 pigeonhole.ﬁLady ™s been calling, Mister
Cadee.ﬂ
ﬁBusiness or pleasure, Stan?ﬂ D on Cadee quirked
an eyebrow shaggy-white as a chicken feather.ﬁM ust
be pleasure, this late.ﬂ He smiled to conceal a swift
premonition. The only young lady who might call
10
his hotel after midnight would be Sibyl Forde, his
best ˛oor operative and severest cr itic.Yet scarcely
a quar ter hour ago he™d said good-by to Sib at her
Village apartment, after a theater-and-Sardi ses
-
sion which cer tainly hadn™t come under the head of
business.
ﬁA M issus Preston, said you know her.ﬂThe clerk
fanned out three phone slips, bearing theTime
R eceived stamp.The ˚rst had come in at ten-˚fteen.
ﬁShe™d like to have you buzz her back, no matter how
l a t e .ﬂ
ﬁStr ic tly business.ﬂ Bad business, probably, D on
decided on the way to the phone booths. O ther wise
Press himself would have called. Even if there™d been
an accident, Ruth Preston would hardly have called
more than once to let Don k now about it.Those
three phone slips – she must be stewing about
something!
I n the three years since Press had been Don™s
assistant as Chief of Protec tion, Ruth had never had
any occasion to be alar med about her husband.That
was one of the things Don liked about Press: it was
hard to think of an emergency which would cause
the big man more trouble than he could handle. No
screeching shoplifter, caught with the goods, clawing
and biting, had ever rattled him into strik ing back.
No after- closing prowler, ˛ushed out of his hiding
place and ˛ashing an open switchblade, had ever
panicked old Press. S o if there had been any hitch in
that assignment tonight it would be something seri
-
ous, or Press would have been able to handle it.
He dialed the Flatbush number marked on the
slips:
11
ﬁH i, Ruth? Don.ﬂ
ﬁOh, Don!ﬂWor r y made her voice shr ill. ﬁJim
hasn™t come home! Do you k now what ™s happened?ﬂ
ﬁNo, I don™t, Ruth. But don™t let it get you in a
swivet.ﬂ He spoke soothingly.ﬁHe went over to the
Buck inghurst with Mister Grolheim, you know.ﬂ
ﬁ Yes. He called around six to tell me not to wait
supper. But he said he™d be home around nine –
now it ™s half-past twelve!ﬂ
ﬁ They ™re having a birthday par ty over there, Ruth.
That k ind of celebration might call for cor ks a-pop
-
ping. –ﬂ
ﬁBut you know Jim. He might take a dr ink or two
– but he™d have called me if he was staying any
length of time, D on.ﬂ
ﬁFew glasses of champagne will make anyone
forgetful,ﬂ He made it sound more reassur ing than he
feltﬁD on™t fret about it. I™ll check and have him call
you back ... or I will.ﬂ
ﬁAll r ight I – I™ve been so upset.ﬂ She sni˙ed.
ﬁHe™s never done this before, all the years we™ve
been marr ied.ﬂ
ﬁAll the more reason you should forgive him for
one little lapse.Take it easy, Ruth. You™ll be hearing
from one or the other of us before long.ﬂ He hung up,
went out of the booth, brooded at the row of tele
-
phone direc tor ies in the rack .
Q uickest way would be to r ing up the lady™s apart
-
ment, ask if Press is still there.
He thumbed the
M anhattan book to the I™s.
I nesco, Inetta, I neval, Inew, I ney ... no Inez.
He looked under Lily. Dozens of Lilys – but no
Lily Inez.
12
Well, hell, that ™s her stage name. Nobody™d have
I nez for a last name. Chances are, too, she™ll have
a pr ivate number, unlisted, to avoid the autograph
pests, the charit y cranks. But the apartment building
would k now.
He found the number, dialed.
A suave voice, with a faintly Br itish accent, said:
ﬁ The Buckinghurst.Whom do you wish?ﬂ
ﬁConnec t me with Miss Lily Inez?ﬂ
ﬁ Ver y sor ry, sir.We have no line to that part y.ﬂ
ﬁ This is urgent,ﬂ D on said.ﬁI have to get hold of
her in a hurr y. Can you give me her number?ﬂ
ﬁ Ver y sor ry.We are not authorized to give out any
infor mation of that sor t.ﬂ The accent hung up.
D on swore sof tly. Myron Grolheim had been right.
Ambletts™ fur buyer had emphasized the sub rosa
nature of the a˜air, had insisted that he never had
k nown who the customer was, had never even been
noti˚ed as to the identity of the recipient until a few
days ago. ﬁ Whole deal is classi˚ed top secret, Don.
Hush-hush and double-shush.ﬂ I t seemed to be so.
Still, there were other ways to ˚nd out what was
delaying Jim Preston™s retur n home – And no time
to be lost trying them, Don realized.
He caught a cruising cab in front of the hotel.
ﬁAmbletts Fifth Avenue,ﬂ he said.
The dr iver craned his neck.ﬁ You must be one
them winda dressers, going to wor k this time night,
hah?ﬂ
ﬁ We tr y to put on a show.ﬂ D on answered irr itably.
He was annoyed with himself for not having
taken the fur buyer more seriously. He might have
expec ted Grolheim to be a little jumpy; having the
13
responsibility for safe deliver y of a hundred-thou
-
sand- dollar item might put any store executive on
edge. But the man had been more than apprehen
-
sive; he™d really been scared.
You saw that, but you
discounted it.You thought he was a wor r y war t, that
his overac tive imagination had brought him to the
point of seeing things at night. But what if Grolheim
had been right about someone trailing him every time
he stepped out of the store?
D on hadn™t laughed at him, of course. But neither
had he taken any stock in the myster ious shadower
who hadn™t been seen clearly enough for identi˚ca
-
tion; what he had done was to agree to convoy the
jumpy buyer and his precious cargo the short dis
-
tance from Ambletts to the Buckinghurst.Then there
had been a hitch.
Grolheim had been instructedŠby no less an
author ity than B ob Stolz, the general manager him
-
selfŠto make deliver y precisely at eight-thir t y.
Unfor tunately that had been curtain time for
Love Life
– for which Don had previously managed
to wangle two in the sixth row center. He hadn™t
wanted to disappoint Sibyl, had said as much to
Press, who had been in the Protec tion oˆce when
D on came back from the fur salon. Old Press had
agreeably taken over what had promised to be a
routine assignment with possibly the added ˚llip of
seeing the sexiest star on television in the ˛esh. At
the time, Press had joked about that. Now it didn™t
seem much like a kidding matter.
M aybe there would be an explanation at the
store.
The austere gray monolith of Ambletts was
14
silhouetted like an ancient temple against the cold,
star- glitter ing sk y ; there were, even at that late hour,
a few window-shopping worshipers at the sidewalk
shr ine of fashion.
D on paid the cab driver, walked the for t y steps
down the side street to the Employees Entrance,
rang the night bell.
The watchman, who answered, saluted smar tly:
ﬁLittle tour of inspection, Chief?ﬂ
ﬁNo inspection, Mike. Just looking for Press. S een
him?ﬂ
ﬁNot since he lef t with Mister Grolheim. Around
eight-˚fteen, that was. I checked ‚em out with that
fanc y-wood case.ﬂ
ﬁGrolheim been back?ﬂ
ﬁNo, sir. He didn™t say anything about coming
back .ﬂ
ﬁUm.ﬂ Don went to the night elevator, waited for
the car to come down with its usual group of chat
-
ter ing cleaning women and glass-polishing porters.
H is concern about Press had become suddenly
coupled with an uncomfor table feeling about Myron
Grolheim.
He wasn™t as well acquainted with the fur buyer as
with most of the store™s top men; Grolheim had only
been with The Store Superlative since S ol Davidson™s
death, a matter of a year and a half. But any man
who could make the grade with Ambletts had to be a
good sound man to begin with. Yet there was some
-
thing odd about Myron Grolheim, something Don
found it diˆcult to de˚ne. The man was so intense,
so high-strung as to seem almost fanatical at times.
As clear ly as if it was just happening, D on could
15
recall the fever ish glint in the man™s dark eyes, the
scarcely suppressed excitement in the tense voice:
ﬁ You think I™m exaggerating, Don?Well, you really
have to see it to understand. I t does something to
you. Come in my oˆce.You™ll see what I mean.ﬂ
16
## CHAPTER 3

**A RUSSIAN CROWN SABLE**

**THE FUR BUYER™S OFFICE,WITH ITS SOMBER**

walnut paneling, the sample table polished to a dark
mir ror by countless pelts of seal and fox and beaver,
had appeared gloomy on the few occasions Don
had been there on business. But this after noon both
oˆce and buyer were transformed.
Grolheim™s chronic scowl was replaced by a ˛ush
of anticipation; the room blazed under spotlights
focused on an object which, beneath its denim
shroud, resembled a coˆn standing on end.
Grolheim closed the door with the air of a conspir
-
ator.ﬁI had the boys in Display r ig these spots so I
could snap a few color shots of Lily Inez.ﬂ
ﬁS o -ho?ﬂ D on was astonished.ﬁ The busty beaut y
makes a personal appearance at Ambletts?ﬂ
ﬁI wasn™t speaking of the lady herself. M erely the
customar y manner of refer r ing to a crown sable
gar ment by the name of the woman for whom
it was designed.The tradition was already old
when the Empress Eugenie assigned one of her
17
ladies-in-waiting to do nothing except care for Euge
-
nie, the coat.ﬂ
ﬁD o they smash a bottle of champagne on the
collar when the coat is launched into society?ﬂ
ﬁI k now – sounds silly, Don. But it ™s all a part
of the regal ceremonials which go with owning the
most exclusive ar ticle of wear ing apparel in the
whole wor ld. S ee, up to a centur y ago no one but
royalt y could buy a crown sable.The C zars had a
lock on the pelts; they would only sell to k ings and
maharajas and maybe an occasional lucky duke.
Nowadays, of course, you don™t have to be listed in
Bur ke™s Peerage to bid for one, but it helps if you™re
in the upper brackets of the Amer ican Social R egis
-
ter, Poors Manual, or Moody ™s.ﬂ
D on said: ﬁI see. S ables have a social signi˚cance
beyond that of, say, mink?ﬂ
ﬁ Why, a Russian crown sable is as far superior to
the ˚nest pastel minkŠin the social scale of furs,
that isŠas a mink is superior to a musk rat! Sables
are for women who are tired of two minks in ever y
closet.You can™t simulate a sable, it ™s impossible to
imitate it. That ™s why it takes patience as well as a fat
purse to get one. I t took six months to match out the
sk ins for this beauty.ﬂ Grolheim whisked away the
cloth, disclosing a cabinet of amber- colored wood.
ﬁ That was comparatively swift wor k . All the pelts
have to be brought halfway round the world from
that one small Siberian town of
Bar zuin
. I t took more
than a year to assemble the Duchess of Windsor ;
even longer to put Barbara Hutton together.ﬂ
ﬁI f you have to rate in the Blue Book to qualify
for one of these items, how did Lily Inez crash the
18
char med circle, M y? I know she™s had a billion-dollar
build-up as Queen of the Kiloc ycles, but still – ﬁ
ﬁ You misunderstand, D on. It ™s the purchaser
who has to rate, not the recipient.ﬂ Grolheim ˚tted
a golden key into a gilded lock .ﬁ That™s because
nobody can tell what a crown sable coat is going
to cost until after it ™s been made.That ™s why you
never see a crown sable adver tised; there™s no way
to quote a price on it. Oh, maybe once a year some
house, just for the hell of it, will show a little clutch
cape at twent y thousand or so – but even then
it ™s Kamchatk a fur, not the genuine Yak ut.What I
mean is, the furr ier has-to k now in advance that his
patron is able to come up with a hundred thousand
or more, without squawk ing, when the garment is
ready for deliver y.ﬂ
ﬁ Who is the patron? ... Or shouldn™t I inquire?ﬂ
ﬁD oesn™t make a bit of di˜erence. I don™t k now,
myself. Fac t, I™m not even sure who does know, Don.ﬂ
ﬁShouldn™t be too diˆcult for some of the keyhole
peepers on the gossip columns to ˚nd out which of
the lady™s admirers is able to pick up a six ˚gure tab,ﬂ
D on said thoughtfully.
ﬁI expect there™ll be some guesses but they won™t
be answered at Ambletts. All my instructions were
ver bal from the beginning, nothing on paper at all,
nothing. M y orders came direc t from the general
manager and he made it clear from the start that the
whole deal is classi˚ed top secret – hush-hush and
double -shush.ﬂ He opened the door.
The Lily Inez swung out into the spotlight beams;
the magni˚cent coat hung from a satin-padded
shoulder form ˚xed to the back of the cabinet™s door.
19
Under that br ight light the sables seemed alive.
The deep blue pelts quivered with constantly shif ting
high lights of r ich chestnut; the shimmering of the
silver-tipped guard hairs gave the uncanny e˜ec t of
sinuous animal movement.
ﬁ You™re r ight, boy.ﬂ D on was impressed.ﬁI™ve
never seen anything like it. I t ™s sensational.ﬂ
ﬁGlor ious, absolutely glorious.ﬂThe fur buyer
caressed the shoulder of the garment.ﬁI t is more
than probable that this is the ˚nest crown sable
ever made. I can scarcely wait to see if the wearer
is wor thy of the coat.ﬂ He ran the tips of his ˚ngers
down the sleeve.ﬁOn the other hand, I can hardly
bear to par t with this lovely thing.You can™t imagine
what this does to a man who has spent his life with
furs.ﬂ
D on said to himself :
You sound like a guy making
love to a gir l. As if you™d like to sleep with that set of
sables.
Aloud, he remar ked:ﬁI expect you™ll be glad
to be rid of the responsibility, boy.ﬂ
Grolheim closed the cabinet with the air of one
shutting the door of a mausoleum. ﬁ That ™s quite
true; it is a bit of a sword of Damocles hanging over
my head until I see it safely delivered to the lady.
I t ™s insured – but only in her favor. If anything hap
-
pened before she signed the receipt, it would be the
store™s loss.ﬂ
D on asked: ﬁ What you worr ying about, My?ﬂ
ﬁNothing, ac tually,ﬂ the buyer said. ﬁNothing I
can put my ˚nger on, at least.ﬂ He switched o˜ the
spotlight. I n the late af ter noon grayness and with
-
out the dazzling sables, the oˆce again seemed
suddenly gloomy ; the buyer, too, appeared glum
20
and depressed; the ˛ush of anticipation, the gleam
of excitement were gone.ﬁI suppose you™ll think it™s
pure hallucination, but I think I™ve been followed the
last t wo or three days.ﬂ
D on said: ﬁHere at the store?ﬂ
ﬁNo. From the time I leave the stored at noon ... at
night.You know that crawly sensation you get some
-
times, when you™re being watched – ?ﬂ
ﬁ You™ve seen this watcher often enough to recog
-
nize him?ﬂ
Grolheim replaced the cover ing cloth. ﬁI k now
what you™re thinking:The little man who wasn™t
there. Hell, it hasn™t been one little man – there
have been two.ﬂ
ﬁ Tell me about ‚em. And don™t get the idea I™m
putting you down for a psychopathic case. I™m not,ﬂ
D on assured him.
ﬁOne is older – the one who picks me up when
I go out to lunch. Dark , maybe I talian, hard to be
sure, never get a really good look at him, he™s always
duck ing into door ways or into a crowd. But I™ve seen
him at least half a dozen timesŠhe waited outside
the Heidelberg today while I had lunch, he was
across the street near our Employees Entrance when
I came out.ﬂ
ﬁAnd the other one?ﬂ
ﬁI™m not so sure about him. But he – he both
-
ers me, more than the older one. I™ve only seen
him once. Last night, as I left to go over to Stel
-
lenhachts™Šwho make up most of our silver fox. I
didn™t see him when I reached the street, though
per haps he was aroundŠI was expec ting the other
fellow, you understand. But between Broadway and
21
S eventh, I stopped and made a blu˜ to peek in a
store window so I could look behind me. And there,
t went y feet away, was this zoot-suiterŠnot even
bother ing to duck into a doorway or turn his head.ﬂ
Grolheim became agitated. ﬁNow I k now I™d never
seen that kid before.Yet somehow I felt as if I recog
-
nized him. It was almost as if I™d seen him in a dream
and waked up to meet him on the street.ﬂ
D on nodded.ﬁ You™d probably seen him before
when your mind was preoccupied so you didn™t pay
any attention to him.Then when you did notice him,
the previous impression came back to you. Did he
follow you the rest of the evening?ﬂ
ﬁOnly to Stellenhachts, I guess. He couldn™t very
well have trailed me away from there; Leo Stellen
-
hacht drove me uptown in his limousine. Not that
I didn™t look for this youngster on the street when
we came out of the Stellenhacht Building. I did. But
neither of them were around.ﬂ Grolheim rubbed his
nose with thumb and fore˚nger in obvious embar
-
rassment.ﬁBut I dreamed about the little son of a
bitch last night.ﬂ
D on grinned.ﬁG o ahead. I™ll be your analyst. Pre
-
tend you™re lying on a couch. Get it o˜ your mind.ﬂ
ﬁI t ™s been weighing on my mind, I won™t deny
that. I dreamed this kid was strutting down Fif th
Avenue in that crown sable ... and I was tr ying to
catch him but the crowd kept getting in my way.ﬂ He
smiled apprehensively. ﬁS chizophrenia? Or demen
-
tia praecox?ﬂ
ﬁNeither,ﬂ D on said solemnly.ﬁPlain, old-fash
-
ioned over strain.Too much concentration on this
big coat deal.We™ll make deliver y to the lady tonight
22
and then you can go tie one on and forget it.ﬂ
23
## CHAPTER 4

**THE FUR BUYER™S ANXIETY**

**NOW, THIRTEEN HOURS AFTER THAT**

conversation, Don could see things in a di˜erent
light.Then it had seemed natural to discount the
buyer ™s anxiety.
Wor r y over the coat had weighed on Grolheim™s
mind, left him prey to the delusion of the chronically
apprehensive, that of being followed by some sinis
-
ter ˚gure. A casual glimpse of a teenager had been
enough to make the youth seem a skulker on an evil
er rand.The subsequent nightmare had merely con
-
˚r med the fact that Grolheim was over wrought.
Now D on was not so sure. The fur buyer might not
have been dreaming up trouble. M aybe the menace
had really been there all the time, lurk ing in a dark
-
ened doorway. I f so, D on had made a bad mistake.
You didn™t exactly give him the laugh-o˜. But nei
-
ther did you take much stock in his stor y about being
trailed. No use to claim, now, that you gave him your
best man to see that shipment across town; maybe
you should have ar ranged for an armored truck .
24
At Grolheim™s desk, his hand moved toward the
phone.Then he realized there wouldn™t be a night
line connec ted through the board for a buyer ™s oˆce.
But he checked, any way; the instrument was dead.
Except for a heav y cr ystal ash tray and an
onyx-base clock that said twent y to one, the only
notewor thy item on the desk was a cabinet pho
-
tograph framed in Florentine leather. A handsome
boy, about ten, in the dress unifor m of some military
school. Sti˜-braided collar, bell buttons, full tailcoat,
white trousers creased to a knife edge. Beneath
the visor of the military cap the boy gazed straight
ahead with ˚erce pr ide, not unlike the expression in
Grolheim™s eyes when speaking of the crown sable.
I n the top drawer of the desk was a jumbled
miscellany of papers. Proofs of Ambletts™ Festival
of Furs ads; memos from compar ison shoppers in
Philadelphia and Washington; glossy prints of the
new dolman sleeve designs. Also Štucked under a
clip holding an item from a trade jour nal about
Fo x
up at Edmonton
Šthere was a long bu˜ envelope,
one of the twice -a-month missives from the payroll
depar tment.
The envelope was still sealed; the buyer hadn™t
bothered to open it. Don slit the envelope.The gray-
green check said thatThe Store Superlative was
prepared to pay to the order of M yron A. Grolheim
the sum of $741.66 after deductions. I t was dated
November 19.
Whatever Grolheim™s wor r ies were, evidently they
couldn™t be money wor r ies, if he could leave two
weeks™ pay lying around since day before yesterday
without taking the trouble to deposit it in his bank.
25
D on replaced the check, tucked it under the clip,
tr ied the side drawers of the desk.They were locked,
as they should have been, according to Standard
Operating Procedure.
D on glanced up at the ceiling: the Display crew
had removed the spotlights. Had Grolheim taken
those color shots? What, exactly, had the buyer
meant to do with the photographs? O ther questions,
too, suggested themselves with stroboscopic speed
as he hurr ied across the fur salon, down to his own
oˆce on the Third.
I f the Lily Inez deal was so damn top secret, why
had Grolheim brought D on into it at all? Had that
been the buyer ™s idea? Or Stolz ™s suggestion?
Suppose someone had ˚gured on hijack ing a
sable coat wor th better than a hundred thousand –
where could he dispose of the loot? Who would dare
wear it? Could you ˛y it out of the country to sell it to
some S outh Amer ican dic tator? Some oil mogul?
I n his own oˆce, D on dug out the Con˚dential
folder on Grolheim. There wasn™t much in it that
helped. M an was a widower with one child. Lived
at 2874 West End Avenue. Had been with Neiman
M arcus in Dallas and later with I. Magnin in B everly
H ills before joining the sta˜ of The Store Superlative.
There was a phone number. Don dialed it on his out
-
side line.
No answer. He kept trying. Nothing but the
bur r-burr ing of the automatic r inger.
Well, hell. Fellow may be in the habit of staying
out till dog™s hours. Or could be he™s shacking up with
some lady love. He may be home in half an hour. Lots
of possibilities. S ome not so good!
26
He rang the Stolz home. A maid answered sleep
-
ily :ﬁNo, suh, Mister Stolz not home yet, nor neither
M issus Stolz. No, suh, no idea when he get home.
Who you say speakin™? Mister Cadee?Yes, suh, I tell
him to call you.... At your hotel?Yes, suh.ﬂ
Leaves it stric tly up to you, boy.You can™t stall
around any longer on account of this hush-hush
angle.
He put the Con˚dential folder back in the ˚le,
switched o˜ the lights, went out to the elevator.
The watchman on Employees™ Entrance unlocked
the street door:ﬁG et hold of Press all right?ﬂ
ﬁNot yet, Mike.What kind of car was Mister
Grolheim driving?ﬂ
ﬁPont y. Green and brown station wagon. Fif
-
t y-six, I™d say.They couldn™t have squeezed that
fanc y-wood box in anything except a station wagon,
‚ less it was a panel truck.ﬂ
ﬁNo. S ort of clumsy thing to handle.ﬂ D on touched
the watchman™s ar m.ﬁD on™t say anything about
Press until I clear it, r ight?ﬂ
ﬁR ight, chief. Hope there™s nothing wrong with
him – ﬂ
ﬁHope so too.ﬂ He k new, now, how Ruth must
have felt for the past three hours. She must have
been sure there was something wrong or she would
have heard from her husband. D on was beginning
to believe she was right.The impor tant thing was to
˚nd out for sure, to ˚nd out fast.
A cab dropped him at the Buckinghurst in three
minutes.There was no station wagon in front of the
avenue™s newest cooperative building or on the side
street to the north.
27
The door man was inside the lobby war ming him
-
self by the log ˚re in the great hearth; he intercepted
D on halfway to the night super ™s desk.
ﬁG ood evening– .You wish to see – ?ﬂ
ﬁM iss Lily Inez,ﬂ Don said.ﬁ Which apartment?ﬂ
The door man passed the buck to the night
super intendentThe super looked pained. ﬁAre you
expec ted, sir?ﬂ
ﬁ Think I am. I™m from Ambletts.ﬂ
ﬁAh – ?ﬂThe super recovered his poise. He waved
languidly.ﬁ The ser vice elevator is closed at ten.ﬂ
ﬁ That ™s all right. I™ll use the same door as the
white folks. Call your tenant. Tell her M ister Cadee
of Ambletts is on his way up. And get the lead out.
I™m in a rush.ﬂ D on pushed the doorman aside ˚rmly,
stepped toward the bank of autotronic cars.
The super huddled with a headphone for a
moment.Then: ﬁShe says to come right up, Mister
Cadee. Apartment S eventeen West.ﬂ
The door man leaped into action.ﬁ This car. M ister
Cadee. Just press S eventeen.ﬂ
The door of 17W was held open by a diminutive
blond maid in a smart, Frenchy unifor m. She stared,
puzzled:
ﬁ You have not brought it yet? M amselle™s bir thday
present? What is the matter!ﬂ
ﬁI don™t k now,ﬂ D on said softly,ﬁ but I damn well
mean to ˚nd out.ﬂ

## CHAPTER 5

**THAT DAMNED COAT**

**DON HAD SEENTHE STAR ONTELE VISION OFTEN**

enough to be an admirer of her brash mannerisms,
her bouncy vitalit y. He felt she was better than her
publicity men managed to have her pictured, which
was usually in such a way as to emphasize her
ample bosom. Sex y she undoubtedly was, but she
was more than the possessor of the biggest pair in
Albuquerque, as the naught y nightclub lyrics put it.
For him, Lily Inez always managed to make even
the cor niest comedy routine seem fresh and funny.
But now, as she came across the big living room to
meet him, he sensed that something had dampened
her customary high spirits. In spite of a dazzling
elec tric -blue gown cut as low as any censor would
allow, she seemed much older than when he™d last
seen her on the big bulbŠ older and either tired or
depressed.
Per haps, he thought, it was because the rose and
gold splendor of the lush décor took away some of
the glamour from her. Or possibly it was because she
29
didn™t have on all that television make -up.The impu
-
dent tur ned-up nose, the mischievous, overwor ked
dimples, the wide mouth that seemed to be made
for heart y laughter, the wild mop of apricot- colored
hair that had started the newest fad in coi˜uresŠ
they were all str ic tly as adver tised on twent y-˚ve
million sets ever y Sunday night at nine. But the
br ight blue eyes did not have that spark le which
had been refer red to in press releases as like the sun
glinting on wave tops; they were dull, red-r immed.
She might, he guessed, have been crying.
There was no indication of it in her voice, how
-
ever.ﬁ You are a bad boy to spoil my birthday part y.ﬂ
She dimpled at him.ﬁI wanted to show o˜ before
my guests but now they ™ve all gone homeŠ except
Elton.ﬂ She waved at the man standing before the
Car rara ˚replace.ﬁElton Hadley, my manager. Mister
– Cadee.ﬂ
ﬁEvening.ﬂ D on bowed.
Hadley was a tall, stout man with a head which
was large even for one of his bulk. He had no visible
eyebrows and a high forehead from which the dark
hair had receded so that his frontal appearance
was oddly like one of those elongated images in an
amusement park ™s tr ick mirror. He ˛ipped a hand in
casual greeting; a hand remar k ably small in contrast
with his huge limbsŠsmall and pudgy like that of
an over fat baby.ﬁ What ™s holding up the parade,
fr iend?ﬂ
D on said: ﬁM ister Grolheim hasn™t been here?ﬂ
Lily Inez pouted.ﬁNo one from your store has
been here, though deliver y was promised positively
by nine at the latest, so I kept delaying dinner and
30
pour ing martinis into people until ever yone was
prac tically crocked.You™ve made me so unhappy– .ﬂ
You™re unhappy
, D on said silently.
What about
Ruth Preston?
ﬁ You haven™t heard from M ister
Grolheim at all?ﬂ
Hadley stroked the lapel of his dinner jacket with
a tiny thumb.ﬁ We haven™t heard from anybody
connec ted with your store until you showed up just
n o w .ﬂ
ﬁ Your coat left the store at quar ter-past eight, M iss
I nez.ﬂ Don decided that Hadley didn™t look like the
sor t of individual who could ˚nance a hundred-thou
-
sand- dollar gif t.ﬁ Two of our most trusted men were
br inging it over. I appreciate your concern about the
sables but I want to know why our employees didn™t
get here.ﬂ
Lily Inez frowned daintily:ﬁPer haps they misun
-
derstood my address ... ?ﬂ She glanced at Hadley
doubtfully.
ﬁD on™t be silly,ﬂ the manager said.ﬁHow could
you misunderstand an address like the Bucking
-
hurst? Mister Cadee thinks these men may have
decamped with your birthday present.ﬂ
ﬁNo.ﬂ Don had the feeling that neither the star nor
her manager was really surpr ised by the non-arr ival
of the sables, that she was following a prear ranged
scr ipt and that Hadley was improvising as he went
along. ﬁI don™t think they ran away with the mer
-
chandise. But someone may have intercepted them
before they reached here.ﬂ
Hadley said: ﬁ You™re from Ambletts™ investigating
bureau, Mister Cadee?ﬂ
ﬁI™m Chief of Store Protec tion. One of the men
31
who started over here was my assistant, Jim Pres
-
ton.The other was the fur buyer, M yron Grolheim.
Nothing can make me believe they would have been
mixed up in anything crooked.ﬂ D on thought Lily I nez
was waiting for a cue before saying anything else.
ﬁOnly alternative is a hijacking ... a matter for the
cops.ﬂ
Lily Inez cr ied:ﬁOh no!ﬂ
Hadley held up one of the ridiculously small
hands: ﬁNow, just a minute, friend.We can™t have
any police publicity, coat or no coat, see?ﬂ He came
toward D on with the false geniality of a politician
about to buttonhole a voter.
Watch your temper, boy.You can™t handle these
people the way you™d deal with some coked-up shop
-
lif ter.This is a kid- glove deal.
ﬁAmbletts isn™t anxious
for any publicity, either,ﬂ he said.ﬁIt ™s our polic y to
avoid it, to protec t our customers from it But if a
cr ime has been committed, the authorities will have
to be noti˚ed. No way out of it.ﬂ
Lily Inez put both hands to her cheeks in a stock
gesture of despair.ﬁFor God ™s sake, don™t do any
-
thing about it tonight! There may just have been
some stupid mistake ... I™ll probably have the coat
by mor ning. Promise you won™t do anything about it
until tomorrow, at least!ﬂ
Hadley beamed approval. ﬁNow that ™s good
common sense, Lil.You™ll admit that, M ister Cadee.
G et the newspaper men in on this now, no telling
what k ind of stor y they™d cook up. One thing sure, it
wouldn™t do your store any good. On the face of it,
there must have been carelessness somewhere, if
nothing worse.ﬂ
32
Lily Inez clutched Don™s ar m.ﬁ Wait till tomor row!ﬂ
D on said: ﬁI can™t promise that, M iss Inez. I have
a responsibility to my people. I™m not going to go to
sleep and forget about them. But I™ll let you k now
before I get in touch with the law.ﬂ
ﬁFair enough.ﬂ Hadley clapped him on the shoul
-
der.ﬁBetter all around that way. Even money it™s just
as Lil says, some dumb mishappenstance. Lil will get
in touch with you, ˚rst thing in the morning.ﬂ
ﬁOh yes,ﬂ she agreed.ﬁAnd no matter what was
wrong, I won™t blame your Mister Preston or Mister
Grolheim. I™m sure it was just one of those things.ﬂ
Don found himself being urged toward the doorŠ
Hadley at one elbow, Lily Inez at the other.
The blonde held the door open. ﬁ The elevator is
here, sir.ﬂ
He stepped in, pressed the Lobby button.
They had their stor y all set
, he told himself.
They
were expec ting someone to throw questions at them
and they had the answers ˚gured in advance.They
k now something about that damned coat. But what?
D own in the lobby, the doorman broke o˜ an
argument with the night super about an entr y in the
˚f th at H ialeah, hurr ied to open the street door.
On the sidewalk D on paused: ﬁ Wouldn™t be
anyone on the service elevator this time of night?ﬂ
ﬁOh no, sir. The night man quits at ten.ﬂ
ﬁBut if a couple of people from Ambletts had
delivered a package here around half-past eight,
they ™d have had to use the service car?ﬂ
ﬁ Yes sir, regulations.ﬂ
ﬁ When did you come on duty?ﬂ D on asked.
ﬁEight o™clock . I saw your two men deliver that
33
pack age ... only it seemed more like a packing case,
it was so big.ﬂ
ﬁ That ™s right. I t was quite a bundle.ﬂ D on tr ied to
keep his tone matter- of-fact.ﬁDid they take it up to
M iss Inez ™ apar tment?ﬂ
ﬁ Well, of course, I couldn™t actually say. But they
went in the service entrance and they were gone, oh,
per haps ten minutes before they came back with the
young man.ﬂ
ﬁA third man?ﬂ
ﬁ Yes, sir. I was busy at the moment, helping
M issus Farley in with her wheel chair, so I didn™t
really pay much attention. But there were three of
them and I supposed someone had come down from
M iss Inez ™ apar tment to help them put the packing
case back in the station wagonŠﬂ
ﬁ They took it back to the car?ﬂ
ﬁ Yes. As I say, I wasn™t watching, being so busy
with Missus Far ley because the slightest jounce
causes her the greatest distressŠbut I did notice
that even with three of them lifting it was hard work
getting that pack ing case back into the station
wagon; it must have been prett y heav y.ﬂ
34
## CHAPTER 6

**A HEAVY PACKING CASE**

ﬁPRETTY HEAVY, EH? MUST HAVE BEEN, TO NEED THE
three of them to lif t itﬂ
How much would Grolheim
weigh? Or Press?
ﬂ You get a good look at these guys?ﬂ
ﬁCan™t say I did.ﬂThe door man considered.ﬁCome
to think of it, believe they all had their backs to me,
while they were putting that pack ing case back in
the station wagon.ﬂ
ﬁ Your man on the service elevator would have
talked to them, though?ﬂ
ﬁI suppose.Why? S ome diˆculty about the deliv
-
er y to Miss I nez?ﬂ
ﬁS eems so. What ™s the name of your night man on
the ser vice car?ﬂ
ﬁS alvatore.We generally call him Sally. Don™t
remember ever having heard his last name. He™s a
tough old bird. Dar k – big nose, black-a- da mus
-
tache.ﬂThe watchman smiled at his attempted
dialec t.
ﬁK now where he lives?ﬂ
ﬁNo. But,ﬂ the door man added helpfully, ﬁ he™s a
35
wop. Chances are he lives in some Italian section.ﬂ
ﬁ That narrows it down,ﬂ D on said drily.ﬁ Wonder
if your superintendent can pinpoint it a little closer.ﬂ
He went back into the lobby.
From behind the barr icade of the desk the super
regarded him war ily.
D on said: ﬁ This S alvatore on your ser vice car,
what ™s his last name?ﬂ
ﬁHow should I know? I don™t make out his
checks.ﬂThe man squinted suspiciously.ﬁ What ™s it to
you, any way?ﬂ
D on scowled.ﬁS omeone around here pulled a fast
one tonight when a deliver y was being made from
Ambletts.This Sally may have been in on it.ﬂ
ﬁI don™t k now what you™re talk ing about,ﬂ the
super said defensively.ﬁAnd I don™t k now anything
about Sally, either. You have any complaint, you™ll
have to take it up with MisterWexberger, the man
-
ager. He™ll be in the oˆce at eight.ﬂ
ﬁHow about getting him on the phone r ight now?ﬂ
ﬁI couldn™t possibly do that. I f you™ll stop around
in the morning – ?ﬂ
ﬁLook , I™m ac ting for one of your tenants in this
matter,ﬂ Don said bleakly.ﬁI t was her proper t y that
was sidetracked or hijacked. If you don™t want to
cooperate, I™ll have M iss Inez put on some pressure.ﬂ
He started for the elevator.
The superintendent came running out from
behind his barr icade. ﬁ You™ll have to wait until I see if
it ™s all right for you to go up again.ﬂ He grabbed Don™s
ar m.
D on clamped a hand on the man™s wr ist, hauled
him into the car, swung him around, backed him into
36
a cor ner. ﬁCome along and see, then.ﬂ He punched
the S eventeen button.
The door man rushed over.ﬁHey, now!ﬂ
The elevator door closed; the car began to r ise
swif tly.
The superintendent glared. ﬁ Who for cr ysake you
think you are, muscling people around!ﬂ
D on made a pushing-away movement with his
palm. ﬁFirst thing you k now, you™ll have me believing
you™re conniving with this hijack crew.ﬂ
ﬁI haven™t been out of the goddamn lobby all
night,ﬂ the other retorted.ﬁI don™t even know what
was stolen!ﬂ
The car slid gently to a stop.
D on crossed to the S eventeen door, thumbed the
buzzer, ignor ing the superintendent, who stayed in
the elevator.
The blond maid opened the door, cr ied ﬁO ooh!
I t ™s not MisterŠﬂ She looked horr i˚ed, tried to slam
the door. ﬁI t ™s that store detec tive!ﬂ
D on held the door open easily.ﬁS orr y to barge in
like this, sister, but I haven™t any time to waste.ﬂ
Lily Inez sat cross-legged on the moss-thick
car pet beside a Car rara co˜ee table, with a highball
glass in her hand. She scrambled to her feet like a
tomboy, disdaining Hadley™s assistance.
ﬁHello there.ﬂ She brought the dimple into instant
play.ﬁI was just saying to Elton how sweet you were
about this ridiculous mix-up.ﬂ She smiled, but not
with her eyes.
D on nodded to the manager.ﬁ Told you I™d let you
k now before I went to the police. I™m going to have to
do it now, unless you can give me some help.ﬂ
37
Hadley answered for her.ﬁAnything we can do,
fr iend, anything at all.ﬂ
Lily Inez spoke sharply to the maid.ﬁ That will be
all, now, Frances.ﬂ
At the door the maid hesitated.ﬁ The superinten
-
dent – he™s out here– .ﬂ
D on said: ﬁShow him in here; he™s part of the
problem.ﬂ
The comedienne murmured doubtfully:ﬁ Why, of
course. Ask him to come in, Frances.ﬂ
But the superintendent took the car down in a
hur r y.
ﬁHe didn™t want to come in,ﬂ the maid reported
sullenly.
ﬁHe went back downstairs.ﬂ She closed the door,
eyed D on disapprovingly as she left the living room.
D on refused a wigwagged o˜er of a dr ink from
Hadley.
ﬁNo thanks. I don™t feel like celebrating. Just
lear ned from your door man that M ister Grolheim did
br ing your sable to the Buckinghurst around half-
past eight. M y assistant was with him.ﬂ
ﬁBut they didn™t come here,ﬂ Lily I nez protested.
Hadley shook his head. ﬁ We haven™t seen hide nor
hair of ‚em.ﬂ
ﬁ They were here,ﬂ D on repeated.ﬁ The two of
them car ried the case with the coat in it, to your ser
-
vice elevator.Then af ter ten minutes or so the case
was brought back out to the street. Only this time
there was a third man with them. Possibly a four th.
They put the case back in Mister Grolheim™s car and
drove away with your coat.ﬂ
And with something else
that was heav y – heav y as Ruth Preston™s burden of
38
wor r y, perhaps.
Lily Inez tur ned to set her highball down on the
co˜ee table, spoke over her shoulder.ﬁ WhoŠwho
were the other men?ﬂ
ﬁ That ™s what I want to ˚nd out.ﬂ D on saw a ˛icker
of ir r itation cross the manager™s face, as if war ning
her about something.ﬁThe door man wasn™t watch
-
ing closely enough to identify them. But your night
operator on the service carŠS alvatore somethingŠ
must have seen them, talked to them. So I have to
get hold of him, only that super claims I can™t get
any infor mation until tomor row morning. I™ll have
the cops looking for Ambletts™ men long before then
if I can™t ˚nd a shortcut on my own.ﬂ He spread his
hands.ﬁM aybe you™d prefer to get hold of the Buck
-
inghurst manager, dig up the dope on Salvatore,
save me some time.ﬂ
Hadley rattled ice cubes in his glass.ﬁNo reason
you shouldn™t do that, Lil, no reason at all.ﬂ He gazed
moodily at his star.ﬁI f that door man was right, it cer
-
tainly does sound like a grab, doesn™t it?ﬂ He took a
gilded handset from a Neapolitan credenza, plugged
a long cord into a baseboard socket, trailed it twent y
feet across the carpet to the cocktail table, handed it
to Lily Inez.
ﬁ What shall I say toWexberger?ﬂ she asked queru
-
lously.ﬁI don™t want to tell him about – my birthday
present.ﬂ
ﬁ You don™t have to,ﬂ D on said.ﬁ You want Salva
-
tore™s name and address and phone number if he
has one. It ™s not necessary to explain why.ﬂ He made
a mental note of the number on the gilded dial she
held.
39
ﬁ Wexberger™ll think I™m schwockedﬂŠshe made a
face Šﬂcalling at half-past one in the morning.ﬂ
ﬁProbably,ﬂ Hadley made an attempt at joviality,
ﬁ he™ll want to come up and join in the revels.ﬂ
ﬁProbably,ﬂ she lif ted the receiver,ﬁ his wife will
think I™m trying to seduce him – hello, Jimmy? See
if you can get MisterWexberger for me ... all right,
Jimmy, it ™s all right, I k now you couldn™t keep Mister
Cadee from coming up – just get MisterWexberger,
that ™s a sweet boy.ﬂ
Hadley came over to D on. ﬁ Your people will be
covered by insurance on a thing like this, I expec t?ﬂ
ﬁI™m not in a sweat about the sables,ﬂ Don said.ﬁI
want to know what ™s with our two employees. S ome
-
times people get hurt in a stick-up.ﬂ
ﬁ That ™s true,ﬂ Hadley agreed.ﬁBut don™t you think
you™re tak ing a prett y gloomy view of the whole
thing?ﬂ
ﬁI™ll be glad to look at it from another angle,
if you™ll show it to me.ﬂ
What the hell is it that
these people knew before I ˚rst came in this damn
apar tment!
Lily Inez hung up the phone, held out a small
memo pad. ﬁS alvatore Buccini, SevenTwenty- one
East One Hundred and Sixth, the Stromboli. Wex
-
berger says he doesn™t have any phone number for
the fellow.ﬂ
D on tore the sheet o˜ the pad.ﬁ This will do for a
star ter, Miss I nez. Much obliged.ﬂ
She patted her explosion-e˜ec t hairdo in distrac
-
tion.ﬁDo you really think my coat is gone for good,
M ister Cadee? I™ll be the most disappointed woman
in this wor ld– .ﬂ
40
He went toward the door.ﬁI haven™t had much
exper ience with the class of thieves who steal crown
sables; I can™t guess what they ™ll do. But I™ll let you
k now as soon as I know.ﬂ
He went down in the autotronic.
The super glared at him. The doorman chided
him:ﬁJeez, I wouldn™t have wised you up to begin
with, if I™d thought you were going to stage a strong-
ar m ac t.ﬂ
ﬁI™m not the one who staged the strong-arm stu˜.ﬂ
D on was bleak.ﬁThat was a couple of other guys.
You may get a chance to identify‚em in court.ﬂ
Ten minutes and eighty cents later a cab dropped
him in the heart of Little Italy. Rows of three -story
brownstones with cobblers™ shops, bars, candy
stores, delicatessens, cafés, groceries, ˚sh mar kets,
phar macies, a jumble of small commercial estab
-
lishments on the ground ˛oors. At 721, which he
had expected to ˚nd a rooming house, a neon sign
shimmered violentlyŠa volcano in quiver ing erup
-
tion. Beneath this glowing red and blue display the
t wisted tubing said:
**C AFÉ STROMBOLI**

He peered through partly cur tained windows.
A small bar, a dozen crowded tables, half a dozen
booths, perhaps thirt y men. Older men mostly, bald
heads, black mustaches against olive sk ins. Steve
-
dores, truckers, plasterers, men who wor ked with
their hands. Dr ink ing, smok ing, playing cards, laugh
-
ing, eating. And all, whatever else they were doing,
talk ing, jabber ing, arguing at the top of their lungs.
D on went in.
41
The tor rent of conversation ceased as if someone
had shut it o˜ at a faucet as soon as the door closed
behind him. The air in the place was hot; the odor of
˚sh and garlic and cheap wine was su˜ocating.
A score of faces tur ned toward him inquiringly,
but no one spoke.
ﬁG ood evening, gentlemen.ﬂ D on moved toward
the bar behind which a ver y stout man wear ing a
stained apron was r insing wineglasses. ﬁI™m looking
for S alvatore Buccini.ﬂ
There was a sound as of wind passing through
a grove of pines. A stir ring of feet. A couple of the
biggest men laid down their cards and shoved back
their chairs.
The stout man wiped his hands on his apron.
ﬁ What was it you wished to see this Buccini about?ﬂ
42
## CHAPTER 7

**SALVATORE**

ﬁIT ™S A PERSONAL MAT TER.ﬂTHE SMELL OFTHE
place reminded Don of dingier cafés he had known
in the war days, only then the customers at the
tables had been much older, or else too feeble even
to wear the Duce™s uniform. Also, in those dens there
had been many women, both young and old. Here
there were only the hard, suspicious faces of the
men, staring at him from the mirror of the back bar.
ﬁS alvatore™s boss at the Buckinghurst said he would
be here.ﬂ
ﬁHe sometimes drops around.ﬂThe stout man
polished a wineglass with a dirt y towel.ﬁI f you wish
to leave your name?ﬂ
S alvatore must be here, Don thought; otherwise
the fat boy would have said so, straight o˜. ﬁName™s
Cadee. Don Cadee.ﬂ He laid a dollar on the bar.ﬁUn
bicchiere di vino, per favore.ﬂ
ﬁCer tainly.ﬂ S ome of the antagonism left the stout
man™s eyes. ﬁ You speak the Italian?ﬂ
ﬁUn tantino. Enough to ˚nd my way around
43
Napoli. I was there during the war.ﬂThe doorman™s
descr iption of Salvatore wouldn™t be much help,
D on decided. M ost of the faces he could see in the
mir ror were swar thy, three out of four were adorned
with large, black mustaches, all seemed to have
large, bony noses. A major ity of the men were mid
-
dle -aged.ﬁA beautiful city, Napoli. Magni˚cent bay.ﬂ
ﬁ The ˚nest in the wor ld, that is true.ﬂThe stout
man per mitted himself a thin smile as he poured the
grappa. ﬁ This matter of which you wish to speak. I t
has to do with Buccini ™s job, per haps?ﬂ
ﬁ Y e s .ﬂ
Why had there been such a stir when he had
mentioned Sally? Were his pals expecting someone to
walk in o˜ the street, gunning for the guy?
ﬁS alute.ﬂ
He raised his glass.
ﬁS alute.ﬂThe stout man made change.ﬁ You like
to leave a message for him?ﬂ
ﬁNo. I have something to say pr ivately, a war ning.ﬂ
ﬁAh?ﬂ
I n the mirror D on could see faces tur ning, heads
swiveling toward one of the booths in which three
men sat. ﬁHe may lose his job if I don™t get a chance
to talk to him.ﬂ
The youngest of the three in the booth got to his
feet heavily, marched toward the bar with the mus
-
cle -bound stride of a man who does much lifting.
ﬁ We are all Salvatore™s friends, mister.You can speak
freely to us.ﬂThere was an insolent challenge in his
manner.ﬁYou tell us this war ning.ﬂ
ﬁFair enough.ﬂ D on carr ied his glass to the booth;
the other two watched him with sullen hostility.ﬁ You
are ready to go to bat for your fr iend; good, ˚ne.
R eason I am here is, I™m going to bat for a couple of
44
mine.ﬂ
The younger man caught up with him, put a hand
on his shoulder roughly.ﬁWhat is this about losing a
job, then?ﬂ
ﬁM ind if I sit down?ﬂ Don didn™t wait for a refusal,
slid into the seat opposite the older of the two in the
booth.The man at his side was sur ly but showed no
sign of fear.The other, as Don sat down facing him,
was plainly alarmed.ﬁI™ll tell you why this Salvatore
is in danger, so he will understand why I am wor r ied
about my friends.ﬂ
The younger man kept his hand on Don™s shoul
-
der until the one at Don™s side spoke gru˙y :ﬁSi
accomodi, Luigi.We will hear what he has to say.ﬂ
Luigi dropped into the empty seat.
D on set his glass down. ﬁI wor k for a department
store, Ambletts, on Fif th Avenue; so do these two
fr iends of mine. Ear lier tonight they went to the
Buck inghurst to deliver a packing case. They had to
use the service elevator run by your pal Salvatore.
But there was some trouble. A couple of crooks were
waiting for them, probably up on the seventeenth
˛oor, after they ™d gotten out of S alvatore™s car.ﬂ
The man opposite D on scowled, scratched at his
shoulder.
He™s your man, for sure. All you have to do is needle
him enough.
ﬁ There was a scu˙e of some kind up
there; one of my fr iends got hurt.These hijackers
heaved him into the packing case along with the
stu˜ they were stealing.Then they made my other
fr iend go back down in the service car, help them lug
away their loot.ﬂ
Luigi growled: ﬁ You call Salvatore a thief?ﬂ
45
D on looked at him gravely. ﬁNo.You are not
the k ind who would have a thief for a friend.ﬂ He
tur ned to the man beside him. ﬁI believe S alvatore is
honest, just as you do. Chances are he didn™t k now
just what was going on. My fr iend who wasn™t hur t
wouldn™t have been able to say anything about the
steal. So there might not have been any reason for
S alvatore to think there was anything wrong. But he
saw the hijackers; he can describe them. They may
be afraid of that; they might tr y to ˚x him so he can™t
tell anyone about them.ﬂ
The man beside him grunted:ﬁHe is in no danger
as long as he keeps his mouth shut.ﬂ
ﬁHell he isn™t.ﬂ D on was aware that others in the
booths on either side were listening. ﬁ That ™s one
reason I came to war n him. I™m going to ˚nd out
what ™s happened to my friends, one way or another,
whether Salvatore helps or not. And when I do run
these crooks to ear th, they will think it was because
he descr ibed them. Then they will try to ˚x him so he
can™t testify against them.ﬂ
The man opposite him wiped his face with a blue
bandanna. ﬁ You are with the police, no?ﬂ
ﬁNo. I work for the store. No connec tion with the
cops.ﬂ
A couple more jabs with the old needle may
do it, boy.
ﬁBut if I can™t locate my friends in a hurr y,
the cops will get in on it.That will make it bad for
anyone who holds back information. Anyone who
does that could get a stretch in the pen.ﬂ
Luigi said: ﬁ You mak ing threats?ﬂ
ﬁNot at all.ﬂ D on drained his glass.ﬁJust trying to
help your fr iend out of a jam. See, there were others
who saw these men; the doorman at the building
46
where S alvatore wor ks, for one. S o we™ll catch up
with them, only a question of time. But time is
impor tant; I want to catch up with them before any
-
thing happens to either of my pals.There™s where
S alvatore can help.ﬂ He lifted the empty glass. ﬁM i si
secca la lingua ... how does it go?ﬂ
ﬁ– dal parlare?ﬂ Luigi chuck led, deep in his
throat.ﬁMy throat gets dry, too, listening – vino!ﬂ
He raised his voice.
The other two hastened to empt y their glasses
before the stout man ar r ived with the bottle.
D on took his time about reaching for his wallet.
The man beside him saw the movement, ˛apped a
callused hand, grunted: ﬁNon costa nulla– .ﬂ
No charge, gratis? A good sign.They wouldn™t buy
you a dr ink unless they were buying your argument,
too. But Salvatore might need one more jab.
ﬁI f I can get a good description of these hijack
-
ersﬂŠhe looked around after the glasses had been
˚lledŠﬂ I™ll have ™em in jail in short order. I f not, they
will still know they ™re being hunted.Your fr iend S al

vatore will have to keep looking over his shoulder
for a couple of months.Watching and waiting for
somebody to come out of a dark alley, stick a knife
bet ween his ribsŠﬂ
ﬁDio!ﬂ the man opposite him burst out.ﬁI f I speak,
they say they will get me. I f I keep quiet, you say they
will ˚nish me, any way!ﬂ
Luigi put a hand on his sleeve.ﬁCoraggio, Salva
-
tore. I think you can trust this Cadee.ﬂ
There was a murmur of approval from the adjoin
-
ing booths.
D on said: ﬁ You are an honest man, Salvatore.
47
An honest man is not a coward. Now tell me, you
saw my t wo friends come in ... the big one with the
shoulders like your Luigi and the red face, the other
shor ter and dark and nervous.Which one came back
down in the elevator with you and the other two?ﬂ
ﬁ The short one with the quick eyes.ﬂ S alvatore
drank o˜ his wine hastily. ﬁ The big man I did not see
again. I did not know it, if as you say, he was inside
this box. I swear I did not know it.ﬂ
ﬁNo. I expect you didn™t ﬂ
What will you say to Ruth,
now? What can you tell her, except that Press went out
on a job you ducked and may not be back?
He kept
the lid on his sudden anger, asked calmly:ﬁ What
about the other two?ﬂ
Words poured out of Salvatore Buccini like wine
from the bottle.ﬁOne was tall, thin, skinny almost,
with a nose that had been broken and a smile like
that of a man telling a dirt y joke. Thirt y, maybe a
year or so older; his eyes were like those of the little
dogs the rich women in the Buckinghurst carr y in
their ar ms, brown and bulge- out, shiny and nasty.
He did most of the talking; I do not think the boy
spoke at all.ﬂ
ﬁA boy?ﬂ Don was astonished.
ﬁNo more than a tween-ager, yes,ﬂ S alvatore
babbled wildly.ﬁHe was like those who hang in the
poolrooms and rob handbags from old women. Long
black hair plastered close to his head with those
things like RudolfoValentino used to wear, long
beneath his ears. He was pale, almost the white of
chalk , and his eyes, they were pale, too, the green
of small grapes.There was also something wrong
with his teethŠt wo of them stuck out in front like
48
the fangs of a wolf. It was this boy who saw that I
wondered why the dar k manŠyour friendŠ did not
speak , although he had talked much on the way
upstairs in my elevator. It was the older man, the
dog- eyed one, who told me to forget that I had ever
seen them; he said to me: ‚Zip the lip, old man. or
else.™ And he drew his ˚nger across his throat – like
this.ﬂ

**DON C AME OUT OFTHE STR OMBOLITOTHE BITING**

wind whistling in from the East River, grateful for
that four th glass of vino which Luigi had insisted
on. But no amount of alcohol would o˜set the chill
inside him.
There was no longer any margin for doubt; Press
had been hurt, maybe worse. Either there had been
a scu˙e up there on the seventeenth ˛oor outside
Lily Inez ™ apar tmentŠ or else Press had been slugged
out in cold blood. I f the curious pair Salvatore had
descr ibed were stupid enough to think they could
cash in on a crown sable coat the way they might
have sold a truckload of liquor, then they™d be the
k ind who would think they could get away with
murder, too. Maybe by this time Grolheim was in as
bad shape as Press. But that was conjec ture; about
Press there was now only the question of how badly
he had been hurt.
D on strode west ward, away from the sidewalk
stores, the kids holler ing around the oil-drum
50
bon˚res, thinking of the times Press had come
through in the clutch.The morning when that
coked-up old biddy had whipped out the hatpin and
stabbed at D on™s eyes; Press would car r y that scar
to the grave.That af ter noon during the Christmas
holidays in jam-packed Aisle Six on the First Floor
when the cor nered bag-snatcher had pulled out
an automatic and started blasting at Alice Ster n;
the psychiatr ists had ruled that the gun-boy was a
maniac who didn™t k now what he was doingŠbut
Press had known what he was doing when he™d
walked into that muzzle. A good man in the clutch,
Jim Preston.
Now someone would have to pinch-hit for him.
I t was up to the precinct boys; running down a pair
of stick-up thugs wasn™t a job for a store protec tion
chief. D on had gone as far as he could go without the
cooperation of the force. One or the other of those
hijackers would probably be in the Bureau of Identi
-
˚cation ˚les.
S ally had given them the complete treatment,
once he had started to talk.The old man had a
remar k able memory, too; he had noticed more
details about that duo than most plainclothes men
would have seen if they had watched the pair at a
line -up. Overcoats, hats, shirts, neckties, even the
suede shoes the ﬁ t ween-agerﬂ had wor nŠS ally had
been able to recall them all. I ncluding the huge star
sapphire on the tall, skinny one™s r ight hand ... spot
-
ting a ring like that was almost as good as having a
name and address to go on. Someone at headquar
-
ters, or in the fur distric t, or in the circle of Lily Inez ™
acquaintances, would be able to put the ˚nger on
51
one or the other of those crooks.
All he had to do was take a cab to Centre Street,
speak his piece, let the cops take it from there. But
maybe it wasn™t quite that simple. M aybe a little cau
-
tion was called for.The hair at the back of his neck
was pr ickling in that uncomfor table way he™d almost
forgotten, a sensation he hadn™t exper ienced since
those nights on patrol, hunting for prisoners to be
inter rogated by I ntelligence. How many times, when
there had been no other indication of danger in the
quiet dark ness behind enemy lines, had that pr ick
-
ling at the back of his neck suggested instant caution
– and been justi˚ed a moment later?
Ex trasensory perception, the medical sharps had
called it, not believing in it at all – but he had no
objec tion to their calling it whatever they liked. It
had never failed him; he was here, alive, and so were
a dozen or so of his company who might not have
come back from those routine patrols if it hadn™t
been for that cautionar y crawling of his skin.
S o now once more he would go slowly, watch
his step. He™d made one mistake, not heeding
Grolheim™s apprehensions: It was clear that the
youth Grolheim had thought was trailing him had
been the one with the plastered-down hair and buck
teeth. Don couldn™t r isk a second blunder; that pair
had taken Press along with Grolheim, so there was
a possibility both Ambletts men were being held as
hostages.
D on™t go blundering into it blind a second
time, boy. Don™t let the blues in the night mess it up,
either.
A cruising taxi slowed. He waved it to the curb,
gave Sibyl Forde™s Chr istopher Street address. Sib
52
wouldn™t care much for the job he had in mind for
her, but she would do it – and there was no one else
who could.
He pushed the button over the 4D mailbox in the
lobby of her apartment building, waited, buzzed it
again.
A sleepy drawl came from the perforated brass
talk-back:
ﬁ Who is it?ﬂ
ﬁ Wake you up, sugar?ﬂ
ﬁD on! Is this love in bloom or something more
ser ious?ﬂ
ﬁI need some advice.ﬂ
ﬁH m. Is that all! How uncomplimentar y. Come on
u p .ﬂ
He went up.
She greeted him satisfac tor ily, but held him o˜
at ar ms length, after ward:ﬁ What, for heaven™s sake,
have you been drink ing?ﬂ
ﬁChianti.ﬂ He admired the ˛u˜y white lounging
robe which set o˜ her coppery hair and innocent
blue eyes.ﬁDago red. Not bad, either. Even when
taken professionally.ﬂ He kissed one of her more
prominent freck les.ﬁI should have talked to you on
the phone; in pajamas, you distrac t me.ﬂ
Sibyl frowned.ﬁ You never carr y on like this unless
something is really wrong. What ™s up?ﬂ
He told her, beginning with the call from Ruth
Preston, ending with Salvatore™s descr iption of the
t wo holdup men.
She interrupted only once. ﬁA crown sable coat!
Why, it must be wor th a fortune.ﬂ
ﬁI t cost a for tune,ﬂ he said,ﬁ but what it ™s wor th to
53
a couple of hijackers, I wouldn™t be able to guess.ﬂ
Sibyl disappeared into the bedroom before he
had ˚nished telling her about the queer reac tion
from Lily Inez and her manager.
ﬁKeep right on,ﬂ she called through the open door.
ﬁI can hear you while I™m dressing.ﬂ
There™s my gal! She k nows you want her to be with
Ruth Preston if any bad news breaks.You didn™t even
have to ask her.
She emerged in a tweed suit that made her look
more like a Junior Leaguer at a hunt club meet than
the best ˛oor operative on Ambletts™ Protection
Sta˜.ﬁI™ll chuck a few things in a bag, only be a
minute. Press lives in Flatbush, doesn™t he?ﬂ
He nodded. ﬁB e better if you went r ight over with
-
out calling to let her know you™re on the way.ﬂ
ﬁ Why, natch; she™d say she didn™t want me to
come. But don™t you think you ought to let Bob Stolz
k now what ™s happened?ﬂ
ﬁI™ll ring him again while you™re pack ing.ﬂ He
dialed the Stolz home.The general manager of
Ambletts answered the phone.
ﬁB ob? Don.We™ve had a bad break.ﬂ
ﬁOh, for God Almight y ™s sake! Now what?ﬂ Stolz
sounded as if he might have had one martini too
many.
ﬁ That little item Grolheim had made up for Lily
I nezŠﬂ
ﬁI k now about it. D on™t tell me Šﬂ
ﬁI had Jim Preston go over to the Buck inghurst
with Grolheim, to play it safe. But the coat was
hijacked somewhere inside the building.ﬂ He gave a
terse account.
54
ﬁ You mean they got away with a hundred thou
-
sand dollars™ wor th of sables?ﬂ
ﬁ They got away with Grolheim and Press, too.
S eem to have snatched both of them. From what I
can ˚nd out, Press was hurt in the scu˙e. May have
been killed. I got a prett y good description of the
stick-up pair, to tur n over to the police Šﬂ
ﬁNo! Great Jesus H. Christ, No!We don™t want
any publicity about this at all, understand, D on? You
handle it on your own; keep the cops out of it. Hear
what I say?ﬂ
ﬁListen, Bob.There are other people to be consid
-
eredŠ Jim Preston™s wife, Grolheim™s family.They
have more at stake than Ambletts.ﬂ D on was blunt.
ﬁ You don™t know for sure that there was a k idnap
-
ping.ﬂ Stolz was less belligerent.ﬁ Wait until you have
some more dope before you call in the police.ﬂ
ﬁ Well, hell.ﬂ D on was surly.ﬁI™ll see you in the
mor ning about it.ﬂ
Stolz howled into the phone.ﬁ You do what I say,
goddamn it!ﬂ
ﬁ‚N ight, B ob.ﬂ D on hung up.
Sibyl said: ﬁI gather thatThe Store Super lative
is more interested in protecting the reputation of
the television tootsie than in protecting its own
employees?ﬂ
ﬁ That ™s right. I™m not sure it™s the smar t thing to
r ing in the blues just yet, but I don™t like to have him
tell me to hold o˜. And you know something?ﬂ
ﬁ What?ﬂ
ﬁI don™t think it™s the lady™s reputation that ™s got
him in a stew, Sib.ﬂ

before her vanit y.ﬁ What scares Brother Stolz is the
hot breath of scandal.This princely giver must be a
fr iend of his or the coat wouldn™t have been bought
through Ambletts. And, of course, he™s a mar r ied
man, or there wouldn™t be any need of all the hush-
hush. S o if the hounds of the law get to sniˆn™
around and nose out the name of this big shot, it ™ll

ﬁHe was more than embarrassed, snug; he was
sweating up a head of steam. M y guess, there™s a
personal angle involved. Maybe B ob™s been wench
-
ing around with this boy in the background, staging
par ties with Lily Inez and some of her cuties on that
Painting the Town
show, while Ma Stolz was down in
Nassau.ﬂ He took her overnight bag.ﬁHowever, the
only damned angle that bothers me is the one Ruth
56
Preston™s wor r ying about.ﬂ
ﬁHow much should I tell her?ﬂ
ﬁNot too much. Not until we k now more. Press
and Grolheim were shanghaied along with the
sables. Maybe they ™re being held as hostages. I f
that ™s the ticket, we ought to hear from the hijackers
before long.ﬂ He put his arm around her shoulders.
ﬁ You™ll have to play it by ear, Sib. I don™t k now how
she™ll take it.ﬂ
ﬁHow do you suppose I™d take it if a couple of kid
-
nappers abducted you, dar ling?ﬂ She squeezed his
ar m.ﬁRuth will be frantic.ﬂ
ﬁ You stick with her till we get something de˚nite.ﬂ
ﬁ Where do you expec t to get it from?ﬂ
ﬁI™m going up to Grolheim™s place, ˚rst.ﬂ
ﬁ You thought there was something o˜beat about
him, didn™t you?That he might have been giving you
a build-up in case something like this happened?ﬂ
ﬁI don™t k now how to put it, Sib.ﬂ D on held back
the door of the little self-service elevator to let her
go in. ﬁ This af ter noon, he was as tensed-up as if
he™d k nown the hijack was coming. Still, he cer tainly
didn™t str ike me as the sort of guy who would con
-
nive with the kind of tough lugs S alvatore descr ibed.
I t was more as if the sight of those crown sables
k nocked Grolheim o˜ his rocker.ﬂ
ﬁ That ˚ts,ﬂ she said.ﬁ The whole business is on
the insane side. Only someone who is a little cracked
could possibly expect to cash in on a coat as conspic
-
uous as the Kohinoor – ﬂ
ﬁ That ™s what I thought, at ˚rst. But they may have
had that ˚gured out in advance– .ﬂ He didn™t elab
-
orate, but added: ﬁI f I don™t get a lead at Grolheim™s,
57
I™m going down to headquarters, see if I can make
either of those charac ters in Cap O ™Ber r y ™s picture
galler y. Here™s a cab, hon.ﬂ
He helped her in.
ﬁR emember what I said, darling.ﬂ She touched his
ar m lightly.ﬁAbout how I would feel if anything hap
-
pened, to you.ﬂ
ﬁLook! Don™t you star t worr ying, Sib.ﬂ
ﬁI don™t like what you™ve told me about ... these
charac ters. Be careful, Don.ﬂ
He waited until the cab had started the long run
to Flatbush, then headed for the subway entrance.
I t was ten minutes before an uptown local rolled
into the chilly station; he spent it debating how
much help he might get from headquarters, how
much he would have to tell about the case to get it.
H is car was near ly empty, except for two dance -
wear y couples up at the other end He propped
himself in a cor ner, found himself staring absently at
a familiar face on an adver tisement opposite:
LaughŠand the Wor ld
Laughs with You at
**LILY INEZ**

Painting the Town
On Channel 19 at 9 p.m.
This and Ever y Sunday
He scowled at the mer r y blue eyes, the saucy
snub nose, the beguiling dimples.
You weren™t so
amusing tonight.The chuck le meter didn™t click o˜
any new records. You weren™t as surpr ised about what
happened to your crown sablesŠand to Press and My
58
GrolheimŠas you wanted me to think you were, either.
He was sure of that much, but beyond that no
conjec ture seemed plausible. She was one of the
ver y few people who could have k nown when the
crown sables would be delivered; she could have
tipped o˜ the hijackers. But why should she have?
D oes a woman about to receive a prac tically price
-
less gift ar range to have it stolen from right under
her nose?
That big-dome manager, Elton Hadley, might
have been the ˚nger man. Might have done it out of
jealousy or spite, not wanting any other man to rank
higher than he did in his star™s favor. I f Lily Inez had
k nown that, or suspected it, she might have ac ted
as she had, cover ing up for him. But, in that event,
why had the manager been at the scene of the crime
when he could easily have contr ived to be some
-
where else? Moreover, why would a professional
man like Hadley, with a considerable reputation
in his own ˚eld, put himself in a position where he
could be blackmailed by a couple of kidnappers who
might have to pay the chair price for a snatch?
Neither possibility seemed to make sense.Yet
there was no doubt in Don™s mind that the heist had
taken place r ight outside the star™s apartment or
ac tually inside it, or that both the comedienne and
her manager had learned something about it before
D on had gone upstairs at the Buck inghurst.
He thought about that blond maid as he got o˜
the train, climbed to Broadway, walked towardWest
End. I t might be worthwhile to talk to her again.
He had expected Grolheim to have an apartment
in one of the majestic edi˚ces tower ing ˚fteen or
59
t went y stor ies and ˛aunting bur nished granite,
weathered bronze, and polished plate glass at the
street level. Like the one halfway up the block there.
But that was 2870; there didn™t seem to be any
other building beyond, other than an ancient br ick
warehouse.
The street was empt y, though there had been
plent y of activity on Broadway, a short distance
east ward. The only car in sight was a slinky black
limousine with a chau˜eur asleep behind the wheel,
a newspaper over his face to keep out the glare of
the street lights.
He didn™t want to wake the man; headed north in
the hope of ˚nding a night watchman at the ware
-
house. Had My Grolheim given Ambletts a phony
address?
No ... a dozen paces further he saw the house, one
of the old three -stor y brownstone fronts set back
t went y feet from the curb line and thus half hidden
to anyone enter ing its more imposing neighbors.The
2874 showed brassily against the weathered stone.
There was a waist-high iron rail above a sunken
areaway and steps leading down; the entrance was
four steps up.The house was dark . Evidently the
buyer lived here alone; if there had been any elderly
relatives or even a housekeeper, the phone would
have been answered. But he might as well ring, to
make sure.
With his thumb on the pearl button, he paused.
The street door was solid oak, but there were t wo
long glass insets on either side.Through the right-
hand glass a spark of light showed, danced about
br ie˛y, expired.
60
S omeone in there with a ˛ashlight!That was a
re˛ec tion along a varnished banister. Nobody who
had legitimate business in there would be using a
hand torch.
He backed o˜ the stoop quick ly, went down to the
shadowed areaway.
Shielded by the gloom, he waited for someone to
come out, waited and listened, heard nothing.
B ehind him he felt cold metal, iron bars guarding
the glass in the upper half of the basement door. He
gauged the width between the grillwor k . I t would be
a tight squeeze but he thought it could be done.
He took o˜ his hat, shoved the crown between the
t wo bars at the r ight, above the doork nob. A quick
jab with his sti˜ened fore˚ngers brought a faint
tink le of glass. Another jab, a br ittle crash. He put his
hat on, slid his hand between the bars, squeezed his
wr ist through the aperture in the pane as far as he
could, felt around for the key.
I t was in the lock, as he had hoped. M ost people
did lock their basement doors and leave the key
inside. He turned the key, withdrew his hand, pulled
the door open.
A baker y truck went by at a fast clip, but there
were no pedestrians on the street.
He stepped inside, into pitch dar k ness, listening.
You™re not too well equipped to stage a break-and-
enter job. No jimmy, no ˛ashlight, no gun. Well, hell,
Press hadn™t been carr ying a gun, either.
H is eyes became more accustomed to the dar k
-
ness. He could make out a storage room, a boiler,
stairs at the back of the basement.
The stairs creaked a little even when he put his
61
weight close to the wall. The door at the head of the
stairs was unlocked.
He took a good half minute to open it as noise
-
lessly as possible, another full minute standing
stock-still when the door was open.
From somewhere above him there was a dull
bumping; it was repeated a couple of times at quar
-
ter-minute inter vals. He thought it sounded like
someone closing the drawers of a desk or a bureau.
Means you weren™t seen, boy; you haven™t been heard,
either, so far.
I t was easier to see, there in the ˚rst ˛oor. A little
light ˚ltered in under the drawn blinds. Enough to
let him tiptoe through a big, old-fashioned kitchen,
down a long narrow hall to the staircase.
He glanced out through the long glass panel
beside the front door. Nobody on the street.
A door opened somewhere in the second ˛oor but
no light showed.
Closet, probably.
He went up quickly; the stairs were carpeted.
From the top of the stairs he could see a slit of
light beneath a door. He decided it was a bedroom at
the back of the house.
S omeone was moving around in there, mak ing no
par ticular e˜or t to be quiet.
He got his hand on the knob of the door, tur ned it
slowly, opened the door fast.
A gir l in a gown spar k ling with sequins backed out
of a closet with an armful of clothing on hangers. A
brunette with a ˚gure that was made for the strap
-
less turquoise gown. Her shoes were turquoise, too,
the French heels studded with brilliants. She turned
to lay the stu˜ on Grolheim™s mahogany four-poster,
62
saw him.
ﬁJesus!ﬂ She ˛ung the clothes on the bed.ﬁJesus
Chr ist, but you star tled me! What the hell are you
doing in this house?ﬂ
ﬁ You beat me to it.ﬂ He noticed she was wear ing
shor t white k id gloves. ﬁ You took the words right out
of my mouth. That ™s what I was going to ask you.ﬂ

ﬁD on™t k now about that; Myron wears the best.ﬂ
He glanced at the pile of clothing on the bed, at the
shor ts and shirts and neckties heaped helter-skelter
in the open Pullman case at her feetﬁBut burglar y ™s
a bit out of my line. I™m on the other side of the
fence. I work at the store with Myron.ﬂ
ﬁOhŠyou do!ﬂ She sidled toward her mink coat,
draped across the pillows on the bed.
ﬁM ust have heard M yron speak of me. I™m D on

the way the silver sequins against the turquoise
emphasized the attrac tive lines of her ˚gure.ﬁAnd if
you™re his ˚ancée you must be Esther.ﬂ
ﬁO f course,ﬂ she smiled brightly.ﬁI have heard him
mention you, Mister Cadee. But he never suggested
I™d run into you, here, tonight.ﬂ
64
ﬁM y apologies for startling you.ﬂ
Look at those
spar k lers on her ˚ngers, boy! I f they ™re for real, they ™re
wor th as much as this house.
ﬁ You don™t have to make excuses. Only Myron
didn™t tell me anyone else had a key.ﬂ She held her
hands out to the disar ray, in mock despair. ﬁHe
sent me to get some of his things ... to take on our
honeymoon. We had a little smash-up tonight. A
car sideswiped us on the Saw M ill River road; the
window broke and the glass cut him so he had to
have nine stitches taken.ﬂ
ﬁS or r y to hear that. But glad he wasn™t hurt
ser iously.ﬂ
She can™t possibly think I™m buying this
boloney.
ﬁ Where is he now?ﬂ
ﬁAt my house in Brewster.ﬂ She waved at the coats
and trousers.ﬁI wonder if you™d pick out a couple
of suits he could wear in Mexico; I haven™t the least
idea which to pack .You see, we weren™t going to be
mar r ied for a month but when he knew he™d have to
keep this bandage on his face for a couple of weeks,
I talked him into having the ceremony tomor row and
˛ying r ight down to Acapulco.ﬂ
She must have a gun in the pocket of that mink ;
if you fool around with that clothing she™ll go for it.
B etter call her blu˜ now.

of this stu˜. He won™t be taking that plane in the
mor ning.ﬂ
ﬁNo?Why?ﬂ She kept her dark eyes on him but
reached out to the mink , her ˚ngers feeling along the
sof t fur for the slit of the pocket.
ﬁ There™ll be detec tives at ever y airpor t looking
for him, that ™s why.ﬂ He grabbed the coat, yanked
it o˜ the bed as if to hold it out for her to put on.
65
The black and silver label behind the gold chain
for hanging up the coat was that of S ari S oeurs, a
fashionable Fif t y-seventh Street couturier ; from the
lining he judged the mink to be almost new.
ﬁ You bastard!ﬂ She struggled to pull something
out of the pocket.ﬁ You lousy bastard!ﬂ
ﬁ You phony.ﬂ He held her wrist tightly. ﬁI never
heard of any Esther.Where™d you get M y ™s key?Who
sent you here to cor ral his clothes?ﬂ
ﬁI did.ﬂ The voice was soft and elaborately casual;
it was only inches behind his ear.
D on turned slowly, seeing ˚rst the polished cor
-
dovan puttees, then the ˛aring unifor m pants and
the chau˜eur™s jacket, ˚nally the gr inning, juvenile
face. Salvatore had pictured thisﬁ tween-ager ﬂ per
-
fec tlyŠthe chalk-white complexion, the sideburns,
the insolent eyes beneath the black visor like the
sof t, pulpy, gray- green inside of grapes.
ﬁLeggo the doozie™s coat before I shoot o˜ your
thumb.™™The boy held the muzzle of the automatic
high, ready to chop down with it.
ﬁM axie!ﬂThe gir l was shrill.ﬁ That was too close
for comfor t. I thought you were asleep at the
switch!ﬂ
The boy pointed the pistol at D on™s k idneys.ﬁ You
haven™t bitch sense, doozie. Handing my name
around like a tip sheet. Now I have to cool this
cook ie, because you told him my name.ﬂ
ﬁNo, no! No, M axie! Don™t!ﬂTer ror dilated her
eyes; she clutched involuntarily at his arm.ﬁFor
G od ™s sake, none of that!ﬂ
D on watched for his chance, but the boy took a
quick step sideways to avoid her; the muzzle never
66
moved more than a foot from the small of Don™s
back .
ﬁKeep away from me,ﬂ the boy snar led at her.
ﬁ You™re so freak ing sensitive, you can stick your ˚n
-
gers in your ears.ﬂ
He™s going to gun you, sure. This is the k id who got
Press, probably. One of these thrill killers. I f you don™t
want to stand still for being shot down in cold blood,
you™ll have to make your play r ight sudden.
ﬁHow you
going to cash in on those crown sables when yon
and your partner will be busy ducking a six-state
aler t, Junior?ﬂ
The boy sniggered.ﬁ You™re nothing but a crummy
burglar. I saw you bust in that door.They™ll give me a
citation for cooling you.ﬂ
The gir l clutched the coat in her arms, moaning.ﬁI
can™t take it, M axie. Don™t do it, for God ™s sake!ﬂ She
thrust an arm toward D on. ﬁSwear you won™t say a
word about either of us! Swear you won™t go to the
cops! Maxie™ll let you live.ﬂ
D on watched the boy ™s eyes; they were basilisk,
unwink ing. ﬁD on™t believe he™ll take advice from you
any better than he will from me, sister.ﬂ
ﬁAdvice?ﬂThe youth chuck led. ﬁI can take the stu˜
or I can leave it alone. Sure.What I wouldn™t take
is your word, not if you swore on a stack of wheat
-
cakes.What I trust is a promise from thisŠﬂ His lips
˛attened against his teeth, the gun jumped for ward
a couple of inches.
ﬁM ax!ﬂThe gir l screamed.ﬁI™ll turn you in, myself!
I will, so help me; I™ll holler cop the minute I get
out of here. And if I don™t get out you k now what ™ll
happen whenŠﬂ
67
ﬁB eat it, babe- o.ﬂ The boy ˛ushed angr ily.ﬁFan
your pants out of here. Go on. I™ll bring the clothes
af ter I™ve taken care ofWhitey, here.ﬂ
ﬁI won™t,ﬂ she ˛ared.ﬁI don™t trust you. I™m staying
until you go.ﬂ
A glint of amusement came into the nar rowed
greeny eyes. ﬁOk ay. Hop downstairs, get me some
-
thing to bundle up the baby.ﬂ
ﬁUse the cords o˜ theVenetians,ﬂ she retorted.
ﬁGive me your k nife, I™ll cut them down.ﬂ
ﬁD oozie, now you taught me. Never fuggle around
with a doozie.They ™ll put you in the corner pocket
ever yŠﬂ
D on lunged as the boy stretched out his left hand
toward her with the switch blade. He struck at the
˚ngers holding the knife, snatched at the barrel of
the gun, expec ting to feel the muzzle blast if not the
˚nal shock.The gir l screeched.
The boy wrenched the gun free, rocked back on
his heels, clubbed the barrel like a machinist using a
mallet.
D on tried to roll away from the blow.The front
sight of the automatic caught him above the left ear.
The screeching was drowned out by an explosion
behind his eyes. –
The roar ing subsided, became a faraway r inging.
He tr ied to put a hand up to the source of the sound.
H is muscles didn™t respond. He tried opening his
eyes, could see nothing. The ringing kept on. –
He didn™t knock your brains out, else your head
wouldn™t be aching as if you had a pneumatic hammer
stuck in each ear.The r inging stopped abruptly.That
sound wasn™t inside your skull; it was a telephone
68
downstairs.
He was cold, shiver ing cold; realized he must have
been unconscious for some time. He tr ied to move
his hands again; they were trussed up behind his
back . His ank les were cord-bound, too.
The second time he opened his eyes he twisted
his head a little, saw a faint line of light above him.
R e˛ec tion on the window sill from the street lights.
Anyhow, you can see and hear.
He rolled over, feeling a carpet scraping bare sk in.
They str ipped you, boy.Took your pants, shorts
Šhe
thumped one foot on the carpetŠ
and your shoes. No
wonder you™re half frozen. Hell, you™re lucky to be half
alive!
I t wasn™t easy getting up on his knees, for his
muscles were sti˜ and didn™t seem to respond any
too well to orders from his brain. He lost his balance
and fell heavily on the ˚rst attempt to r ise, banging
his head against the open closet door. But on the
second tr y he made it and stayed erec t, leaning
against the wall. Hobbling slowly and using the
wall for support he made it over to the light switch,
tur ned his back to it, put on the light.
From the mir ror across the room a Halloween
mask leered back at him. A mask crusted with blood,
black with bruises.
He went to wor k on you after he
slugged you out. M aybe that ™s what happened to
Press. M aybe Press is still alive, too.
I t took ˚ve minutes of spine-jolting agony to
hop out to the stairs and down, clinging to the
banister. By the time he™d hobbled to the k itchen
he was drenched with cold sweat.The nex t move
was simpler. Back up to the k itchen table, pull out
69
the drawer, fumble around for a bread k nife, jam its
blade between the edge of the table and the closed
drawer, saw the cord at his wrists.
Af ter his ankles were free he put his head under
the tap at the sink , used a dish towel.
I n the pantr y was an unopened bottle of slivovitz;
he opened it, took it back upstairs with him. Af ter
the third drink the pneumatic hammers made less
racket.
There were none of Grolheim™s clothes in the
closet.They ™d car ted every last stitch away. Not even
a pair of shorts had been left. The suitcase had been
taken; all the suits on the bed had been removed.
You don™t think you could make it back to your hotel in
a bedspread, do you?
He went back downstairs.There was a hall closet
there, but it, too, had been cleaned out except for a
raincoat. He tried it on; it didn™t reach to his k nees.
Well, hell ... he could always call the hotel, get
one of the bellhops to br ing up or send up a suit and
a pair of shoes. He went to the phone in the living
room. I t rang before he picked it up.
ﬁHello,ﬂ he said.
ﬁD on! I™ve been ringing you ever since three
o™clock!ﬂ
ﬁ What time is it, shugie?ﬂ
ﬁI t ™s quarter past four. Are you crocked or some
-
thing?You sound so queer!ﬂ
ﬁA little cracked tip. But not crocked.ﬂ
ﬁAre you all right?ﬂ Sibyl was wor r ied.
ﬁI™m in my right mind, even if I™m not fully
clothed.ﬂ
ﬁD on! What happened?ﬂ
70
ﬁM ade contac t with some of the hijack squad,
shugie.ﬂ
ﬁS o did we!ﬂ she exclaimed. ﬁ That ™s why I™ve been
calling you. I talked to M ister Grolheim – and he
says everything is going to be all right and Press will
be home in a day or so if we just sit tight and take it
easy.ﬂ
He stared incredulously at the instrument in
his hand.ﬁAre you sure you were talking to My
Grolheim?ﬂ
ﬁO f course I™m sure. I k now his voice. He called me
Sibyl and he was just as reassur ing as he could be,
under the circumstances.ﬂ
ﬁ What circumstances?ﬂ
ﬁ Well, he couldn™t explain exac tly. But he did
say things would all be straightened out in a day or
so Šincluding the retur n of the coat to Lily Inez. And
Press would come back when he did.ﬂ
ﬁUmŠwhere was he calling from?ﬂ
ﬁA bar somewhere. Not in town. He called from a
coin booth. Ruth talked to him, too, for a minute.ﬂ
ﬁAre you staying there with her?ﬂ
ﬁNo. She feels better about Press now ; she™s going
to take a phenobarb, get some sleep.ﬂ
ﬁ Then you can be a nice St. B er nard dog and
come over here with a keg.ﬂ
ﬁ You sound stewed!ﬂ
ﬁI don™t mean a keg of brandy. I have a supply
of slivovitz. But you stop at my hotel and Stan will
have a keg there for you to br ing up here. K now the
address?Twenty- eight S event y-fourWest End.ﬂ

showing across the roof tops to the east by the time
Sibyl ™s taxi pulled up in front of Grolheim™s house.
The cabman helped her with a heav y suitcase as far
as the steps but then she waved him away, though
she eyed the unlighted entrance doubtfully.
D on opened the front door.ﬁAll quiet on the West
End front. I™d help you with the bag, only they might
run me in for indecent exposure.ﬂ
ﬁDar ling!ﬂ Sibyl ignored his bath-towel-and-
blanket costume, winced at his swollen face, now
showing bruises in more colors than the dawn sk y.
ﬁHave you had a doctor?ﬂ
ﬁAll I need is the beautiful nurse.ﬂ His gr in was a
little lopsided, due to the swelling at the lef t-hand
cor ner of his mouth where the gunsight had gashed
the sk in. ﬁCome in the kitchen; I™ve made co˜ee. Ever
tr y black co˜ee laced with slivovitz?ﬂ
72
ﬁD on™t be ˛ippant.You fr ighten me.What hap
-
pened to you, for G od ™s sake?ﬂ
ﬁCall it careless dr iving, shug. I forgot that only
a hack ie would go to sleep behind the wheel with
a newspaper over his face to keep the light out. A
unifor med chau˜eur wouldn™t have done that and I
should have noticed it.When I got to horsing around
with a busty brunette, her chau˜eur chum came
out from behind his newspaper, put a gun to me,
str ipped me stark nekk id.ﬂ
ﬁ You meanŠwhile she was right here?ﬂ
ﬁOh yes. I have no sense of shame. I™d say if she
hadn™t been here then, I wouldn™t be here now.The
chau˜eur wanted to cool me, as he put itﬂ He poured
co˜ee for her.ﬁ Tell me what Grolheim said.ﬂ
Sibyl inspected his battered head.ﬁYou must have
a doc tor! You might be walk ing around with a frac
-
tured sk ull.ﬂ
ﬁI t ™s not as bad as it looks.ﬂ
ﬁI t looks perfec tly frightful.ﬂ
ﬁ You should have seen me before I took a
shower.ﬂ He set the suitcase on the sink and opened
it, nodding with satisfaction. Stan had followed
instruc tions prett y well, except he™d put in the brown
shoes.ﬁHow come it was you who happened to talk
to Grolheim?ﬂ
ﬁI made Ruth take a hot bath, hoping it would
help her get to sleep.While she was in the tub the
phone rang. I recognized Grolheim™s voice, though
probably I wouldn™t have if we hadn™t just been
talk ing about him. He asked if he was speak ing to
M issus Preston and I said no, it was M iss Forde on
the line. He said ‚ Why, hello, Sibyl ™ and ‚I suppose
73
you™re wor r ied about Press™ and I told him we cer
-
tainly were.ﬂ
ﬁ Was it a local call?ﬂ
ﬁNo. Long distance. Coin phone; I heard the
quar ter drop. Bar or restaurant, there was a juke
box playing while he was talk ing.ﬂ Her eyes showed
alar m when he ˚shed his service pistol out of the
suitcase. ﬁD o you think this chau˜eur is coming back
here?ﬂ
ﬁNot likely.ﬂ He stepped into the hall, out of sight,
to put on the shorts Stan had sent.ﬁBut it wouldn™t
sur pr ise me if I ran into him somewhere; nex t time
I would rather be on more of an even footing with
him. G o on about Grolheim.ﬂ
ﬁHe said there was really nothing to worr y about;
he™d be back at the store sometime todayŠ or at the
latest by tomor rowŠand Press would be with him.
There™d been an attempt to steal the sables but it
had been due to a misunderstanding and he was
helping to straighten it out. I n the meantime, no one
should report the temporar y detentionŠthat ™s what
he called itŠ of Press and himself to the police or the
FBI or any detec tive agency. I f we just sat tight every
-
thing would come out all right ﬂ
ﬁUm.ﬂ Don put on his shoes.ﬁDid he sound as if he
was talk ing with a gun in the small of his back?ﬂ
ﬁNo. He was just as casual as if I™d met him by
accident while I was strolling through the fur salon.ﬂ
She sipped at the café royale, wondered about the
stack of canceled checks in the middle of the kitchen
table.ﬁI asked him if there was any way we could get
in touch with him and he said that under the circum
-
stances he wouldn™t give me a phone number to call.
74
But he would give you a ring later on today.ﬂ
ﬁDid he explain why Press wasn™t calling his own
home instead of getting My to do it?ﬂ
ﬁ Well, Ruth spoke to himŠshe came ˛ying out
of the bathroom when she heard me mention
his nameŠand he told her that Press was being
detained as a sort of hostage for M ister Grolheim™s
good behavior and couldn™t come to the phone.
But if no one rang the police or the Depar tment of
Justice boys in on the deal, ever ything would tur n
out all right. S o Ruth sent Press a message: ‚ We are
sitting tight and tak ing no action until you are safely
home.™ She wanted me to be sure and get you to
keep that promise.ﬂ
ﬁI t ™s too damned unanimous to suit me.ﬂ Don
came, back to the k itchen, tucking in his shirt.ﬁLily
I nez begged me not to call in the cops. Her manager,
Hadley, was sure it would be the wrong thing to do.
B ob Stolz ordered me to stay away from the author
-
ities. Now My Grolheim comes up with the same
request. And Ruth joins in the chorus.ﬂ
Sibyl was shocked.ﬁ You don™t want to do any
-
thing that ™ll hur t Jim Preston™s chance of coming
back unharmed.ﬂ
ﬁNo. O f course I don™t.You know I don™t, Sib.
But I don™t think he™s coming back unharmed. My
run-in with the junior member of this hijack team
makes me a little leery on that score. Neither do I
think Grolheim is coming back to Ambletts today or
tomor row. Come on up to the bedroom.ﬂ
ﬁSir?ﬂ She tur ned her head to look at him out of
the cor ners of her eyes.
ﬁ Want to show you why, shug.ﬂ He led her
75
upstairs. ﬁ These heisters have a fondness for other
folks™ clothing.When I walked in on this brunette
babe, she was pack ing Grolheim™s suitcase with
stu˜ from his bureau and carting his suits out of
the closet there. I f they ˚gured on letting him loose
sometime later today, why did they go to all that
trouble!ﬂ
Sibyl stared at the heap of bloodstained towels by
the bathroom door.ﬁI can™t think of any reasonable
explanation, darling. But I™ll guarantee that M ister
Grolheim thought he was going to come back to the
store this after noon; aside from sympathizing with
Jim™s wife, he sounded as if he didn™t have a care in
the wor ld.ﬂ
ﬁI don™t understand it either.ﬂ D on scooped up the
towels, tossed them in the bathtub.ﬁBut there™s evi
-
dently been quite a transfor mation in the man since
yesterday after noon. He was as jumpy as a gent in a
dentist ™s chair, waiting for the buzz of the drill.ﬂ
She touched his swollen mouth with a gentle
˚nger tip.ﬁI™m prett y jitter y myself ; suppose that
chau˜eur should have come in while we™ve been up
here.ﬂ
ﬁI t ™s nearly daylight. Doubt if that lad is anxious to
show his face around here in the daytime. Let ™s have
one more cup of co˜ee, then I™ll let you pay my cab
fare downtown.ﬂ
ﬁ They took all your money!ﬂ
ﬁHundred ˚ft y bucks or so. M ore important, they
took all my master keys for the store. M eans we™ll
have to have a couple of thousand lockers altered.
AlsoﬂŠhe patted her ar mŠﬁ they made o˜ with that
wr ist watch you gave me last Christmas.ﬂ
76
ﬁ That can be ˚xed more easily than those
bruises.ﬂ She followed him downstairs, peer ing anx
-
iously at dark cor ners, shadowy door ways.ﬁ You™re
still con˚dent M ister Grolheim wasn™t behind – this
whole thing?ﬂ
ﬁI™ll leave it to you, snug.ﬂ He took her to the
k itchen. ﬁ These checks were in a locker drawer in his
secretar y in the living room: I picked the lock. Look
at these....ﬂ He ˛ipped some canceled checks across
the table to her.
She studied them. Fif ty dollars to the St Lucretia
Fund for M uscular Dystrophy patients. A hundred
to the Children™s Hospital.Twent y-˚ve to the Asso
-
ciation for the Blind. Five hundred to B ™nai B™r ith
R ehabilitation Program. Six, for eight y-˚ve apiece to
the Merc y Home for the Aged in Lee, Massachusetts.
D on said,ﬁ There are a bunch of checks made out
to the Highland M ilitary Academy up in Worcester.
He has a ten-year- old son up there ... or maybe a
nephew. I might be a sucker but I can™t believe a man
who™d send his money on those errands would con
-
nive with a bunch of crooks.ﬂ
ﬁOh no,ﬂ she agreed.ﬁStillŠﬂ
ﬁStill you can™t understand why Grolheim seemed
so unconcer ned about Press. Neither can I. But I™ll
tell you something, hon.ﬂ
ﬁ Yes?ﬂ
ﬁ You and I are not going to sit with our hands in
our laps waiting for My Grolheim and Press to walk in
the Fif th Avenue entrance.ﬂ
ﬁNo?ﬂ
ﬁNo.We™re going to do a bit of researching on our
own. And the ˚rst thing we™re going to look up is the
77
biggest breakfast on Broadway.That is, if you have
enough money with you.ﬂ
78
## CHAPTER 12

**AMBLE TTS**

**DON LEANED BACK IN HIS SWIVEL CHAIR AS IF HE**

were at the barber ™s; the steaming hot towel over
his face aided the illusion. He felt the e˜ec t of the
beating much more now, at half-past eight, than
he had at four-thir t y. His head throbbed, his eyes
ached, his ears rang as if someone were pounding tin
pans at his temples.
Sibyl sloshed another towel in the cut- glass
punch bowl she™d bor rowed from Glasswares; it
stood in the center of his desk blotter, full of steam
-
ing water.ﬁ You think that turquoise gown was an
impor t?ﬂ
ﬁ Who can tell the di˜erence,ﬂ he mumbled,
ﬁ between an import and a copy? All I™m saying is, it
looked like a couple of hundred bucks, maybe more.
I t wasn™t the sort of dinner dazzle she could have
picked up on Thir t y-fourth Street. I™d ask around on
Fif t y-Seventh. Her mink had a Sar i Soeurs label; if
you can get a list of their mutation customers for the
last year, she ought to be among the elect.ﬂ
79
ﬁI t will probably take a subpoena from the dis
-
tr ic t attor ney ™s oˆce to make them give up that
listŠthere™ll be a hundred kepties on it, most likely.ﬂ
She replaced the cold towel with the hot, waving
it expertly to cool it before putting it over his face.
ﬁ The dinner gown may be a better chance. Daring
décolletage, splashy with sequins – someone might
remember who bought a turquoise pretty like that.
I™ll give it a whirl.ﬂ
ﬁOne more steaming like this and you™ll be able
to ser ve me with lemon butter and a claw cracker,ﬂ
he protested.ﬁLet me cool o˜ a little before Baisha
G ates gets here; she™ll think I™m a fugitive from a
Finnish bath.ﬂ
ﬁI f ever ything about those crown sables was so
sotto voce, what makes you think she™ll know who
st yled the coat?ﬂ
ﬁFrom what Grolheim told me there aren™t more
than a couple of fur houses that could have had the
pelts on hand. M ost of those Seventh Avenue cutters
never handle a sable skin in a lifetime. M iss G ates
will know who could have put the Lily Inez together.ﬂ
He was not at all sure that anyone at the fur house
would recognize Junior or the older man with the
nast y smile or even the brunette. But one of that
tr io might be connec ted with the ˚r m that made the
coat; he had to check through on it.
ﬁ Who™ll take my place on the First?ﬂ Sibyl asked.
ﬁI™ll switch Polly Howar th down there. Problem
is, who™ll take Press™s place here while you and I are
out of the store?Think Alice Stein can sit in here all
r ight?ﬂ
ﬁAlice can handle anything up to and including a
80
judo expert. Sure.ﬂ Sibyl took the towel away. ﬁ You
do look a bit on the boiled-lobster side, but the
swelling has gone down.ﬂ
A glass button on the intercom glowed red. He
touched the Talk toggle.ﬁYes, M iss K ahn?ﬂ
H is secretar y said:ﬁMiss G ates.ﬂ
D on straightened up.ﬁMiss Forde will be out in a
minute, Beck y.Then send Miss G ates r ight in.ﬂ
Sibyl picked up the punch bow.ﬁ What ™ll I say to
Ruth if she calls?ﬂ
He stared blankly out of the window at the tops
of the Fifth Avenue buses, like clumsy green beetles
crawling through the tangle of traˆc.ﬁ Tell her we™ll
stay away from the boys with the badgesŠfor today
at least.ﬂ
ﬁ Thank the good Lord. I thought you™d be hell-
bent for headquarters as soon as you had seen Bob
Stolz.ﬂ She kissed him lightly on the ear, marched
out, car r ying the punch bowl like a tour nament
trophy.
Baisha G ates came in hesitantly. She was a thin,
spinster ish woman in horn-r im spec tacles which
made her look like a harassed schoolteacher. ﬁOh,
my gracious!ﬂ She held up her hands in horror.
ﬁ You™ve been in an accident, M ister Cadee!ﬂ
ﬁS or t of.ﬂ He motioned her to the chair beside his
desk . ﬁBut don™t waste any sympathy on me; it was
my own fault. Do you k now anything about a crown
sable coat that Ambletts sold recently?ﬂ
M iss Gates took o˜ her glasses, evidently feeling
that her appearance was improved by their removal.
ﬁAs a matter of fact, I do. Though I™m not supposed
to. I learned about it only yesterday. Mister Grolheim
81
told me that if anything happened to him, someone
in the department should at least know the bare
details.ﬂ
ﬁ When did he tell you that?ﬂ
ﬁR ight after lunch yesterday.ﬂ She leaned toward
him anxiously.ﬁHas something happened to him,
M ister Cadee? He™s invariably at his desk by quar ter
past eight unless he™s illŠ and then he always tele
-
phones me to say he™ll be staying home. But I called
his house just before I came to your oˆce and I
couldn™t get him.ﬂ
ﬁI n con˚dence, M iss Gates, M y had to go out of
town unexpectedly. He may be in later today. You
k now who made the sable coat?ﬂ
ﬁ Wolheim Ber kowsk y, who else? No other house
could touch an order like that. But I must say it ™s a
queer business, all the way round.The largest single
sale in the histor y of the store – and not a line of
publicity about it! Cer tainly the most fabulous cre
-
ation the fur trade in this countr y has ever k nown –
and our Fur Salon isn™t allowed to share the prestige.
Why, I told Mister Grolheim it™s a sin and a shame; if
we could show that coat for three days it would be
wor th a dozen full-page ads in the papers.ﬂ She was
indignant.
ﬁI expect M ister Grolheim was ready to agree with
y o u .ﬂ
ﬁNo, he wasn™t. HeﬂŠshe hesitatedŠﬂseemed
afraid to talk about the whole transac tion. At least
he wouldn™t tell me who bought it or who it had
been made for.ﬂ
ﬁHe had orders from M ister Stolz not to men
-
tion names. But just between us and not to go any
82
fur ther, the crown sables were for Lily Inez.ﬂ
She clasped her hands in delight.ﬁHow perfec tly
mar velous! She will carr y a coat like that! I t takes a
personage to wear such a garment.Wonder ful!ﬂ
ﬁI™ll have to let you in on another secret, M iss
G ates.The coat was never delivered to the lady. It
was stolen.ﬂ
She gaped at him.ﬁStolen,ﬂ she whispered.ﬁOh,
no!ﬂ
ﬁ Yes. It ™s just possible that the tip- o˜ to the
thieves came from the B erkowsk y end. Do you
happen to k now anyone in the ˚rm?ﬂ
ﬁM or r y Ber kowsk y. He™s vice president, sales man
-
ager.We get most of our broadtail from him.ﬂ
ﬁS ee if you can set up an appointment for me to
see him at his place soon as possible, will you?ﬂ
ﬁ Why, yes, Mister Cadee.ﬂ She put a palm to her
cheek , as if she had a toothache.ﬁDo you think
M ister Grolheim could possibly have had a premoni
-
tion about the theft? He seemed so – well, agitated,
I guess you™d say – yesterday when he spoke to me
about it.ﬂ
ﬁI think the responsibility was getting him down,
that ™s all.ﬂ He saw the red eye of the intercom wink
on and o˜.ﬁ Yes, M iss Kahn?ﬂ
ﬁM ister Stolz on One, Mister Cadee.ﬂ
He ˛ipped the switch, took the phone.ﬁ Yes, B ob.ﬂ
ﬁAny news on that coat, D on?ﬂ
ﬁS ome. See you?ﬂ
ﬁCome ahead.ﬂ Stolz hung up.
D on took Miss G ate™s arm.ﬁ You won™t mention
any of this to anyone outside the Protec tion Oˆce.ﬂ
ﬁOh no. No indeed, M ister Cadee.ﬂ
83
ﬁLet Miss K ahn k now as soon as you arrange that
appointment.ﬂ He had a troubled expression in his
eyes as he watched her leave.
The loud-speaker system was blatting away with
its pre -opening pep talk as he went down the corr i
-
dor to Stolz™s oˆce:
– Ambletts™ buyers have given you the advantage
of being able to o˜er to your customers merchandise
which is in many cases obtainable in no other store.
Your attitude should re˛ect the consciousness of this
super ior qualit y – and if it does, your sales books will
re˛ec t it also– .
The bland voice from the electr ical mouth irr i
-
tated him more than usual this morning; he was
supposed to think of the store™s reputation, too –
but there was something more impor tant at the
moment.
Stolz took the fat cigar out of his jowly face.
ﬁChr ist in the foothills! Who ran you through the
cement mixer?ﬂ
ﬁA drape -shape teenager. One of the pair who
shanghaied Press and Grolheim.ﬂ He gave a high-
spot report of his visit to the house on West End, of
Sibyl ™s conversation with Grolheim. ﬁComes down
to this, Bob.This crew are playing for time.Time to
cash in on the steal. My guess is that when that time
is up, My Grolheim™s time and Jim Preston™s time is
up, too.ﬂ
Stolz paced his big oˆce like a panther in a cage.
ﬁ Your idea is, Grolheim planned the hijack?ﬂ
ﬁNo, I don™t think so.ﬂ
ﬁ Well, then, for G od ™s sake Šif you don™t think he™s
wor k ing with these crooks, why don™t you believe
84
what he says about our getting back the sables and
about his coming back to the store with Preston?ﬂ
D on pointed to his face. ﬁI have to believe what
I saw up at Grolheim™s house.What that juvenile
maniac did to me. M aybe they™ve hexed Grolheim
so he believes they™re going to let him and Press
go. But I don™t think they will. And whether you ˚re
me here and now or not, I™m not going to sit on my
hands while that bunch of bandits gets ready to bury
a couple of good men. I™m going to keep Ruth Pres
-
ton™s promise but I™m going after them myself.ﬂ
Stolz held up a placating palm. ﬁI won™t ˚ght you.
And I won™t ˚re you, D on. I™m with you ... but our
hands are tied, boy.ﬂ
D on smiled wryly.ﬁI™ve had some exper ience,
wor k ing with my hands tied. For a star ter, tell me Š
who™s paying for that hundred-thousand-dollar
jacket?ﬂ

general manager doodled fretfully on his desk pad.
ﬁG ave my word not to.ﬂ
ﬁ We can ˚nd out the hard way.ﬂ D on tr ied to hide
his ir ritation; he needed Stolz on his side if he was to
get any where on this matter.ﬁBut it ™ll hold us up if
we have to fool with the scandal scavengers on the
newspapers.ﬂ
ﬁAll you™d accomplish would be to stir up a stink,
which is what we want to avoid.ﬂ
ﬁ What I want to avoid is sending ˛owers to Ruth
Preston.You™re looking at this in ter ms of saving
somebody ™s reputation, Bob. I t ™s a matter of saving a
couple of lives.ﬂ
ﬁUnderstand that ﬂ Stolz ˛icked at his intercom
set.ﬁAnn? See if you can put me through to Nor m
R ettjer.ﬂ He eyed D on blandly.ﬁBut I don™t under
-
stand about Myron Grolheim. My experience with
him has been that he™s inclined to look on the dark
-
est side of a situation. So if he says this is all going to
86
come out in the wash ... ?ﬂ
ﬁHe might be r ight, Bob. I hope he™s r ight. But
I have to play it on the basis of what happened
up there on West End.ﬂ I
s he giving you the tip- o˜?
Nor man K. R ettjer?The celebrated specialist con
-
sulted by ailing cor porations? The doc tor for sickly
dividends? Fellow supposed to be able to sit in on a
di˜erent directors™ meeting ever y day in the month.
That would ˚gure. One of his companies might be
pick ing up the tab for Painting theTown. He might
have met the lady.
Stolz said: ﬁHow are you going to play it?ﬂ
ﬁ We have some top cards. I™ve met two of the
hijack crew face to face, I have a good description
of the third man. I t shouldn™t take too long to iden
-
tify one or the other of them. Maybe one of them
wor ked at Ber kowsk y ™s. Lily Inez may know one of
them.We™re trying to trace the brunette through
her mink or her gown. I™m going through the ˚les in
the Bureau of Identi˚cation; way those guys wor ked
makes me think they may have been run in, at one
time or another, for jumping.ﬂ
ﬁJumping? Trailing a truck , making o˜ with it
when the driver stops at a gas station or a lunch
wagon? Don™t see the connec tion. – ﬂ
ﬁS ame technique, B ob. A jumper never goes after
a loaded truck unless he knows, beforehand, what ™s
in it and how much it ™s worth and where it™s going.
The ac tual snatch only takes a minute Šhot-wiring
the motor so it can be started without a key. All the
wor k is in getting the dope on the load, the dr iver,
the destination.That ™s how it was done with the
crown sables, too.They had been trailing Grolheim.
87
They were waiting for him at the destination.ﬂ
The voice of the secretar y was a mere mur mur
from the intercom:ﬁM ister Rettjer is not at his oˆce,
M ister Stolz. H is secretary will have him call you back
as soon as he comes in.ﬂ
ﬁAll r ight, Ann.ﬂ Stolz might have been sitting
behind a pile of blue chips with a deuce in the hole,
waiting for Don to bet. ﬁPlay it cagey, boy. Keep away
from those newspapers. Don™t stir up a stor m when
the whole thing may blow over with nobody hurt.ﬂ
He added hasty apology. ﬁNobody else, I mean.ﬂ
I™m supposed to take that beating in line of duty
and just forget about it, no hard feelings? Hell you say,
brother!
ﬁI™ll be out of the store some. Sib Forde will
be, too. Long as Press isn™t around, I may ask Alice
Stein to take over on the inter views.ﬂ
On his way down from Stolz ™s oˆce he was
paged over the public-address system to break up
a distur bance at the Adjustment Bureau, where an
infur iated woman had resorted to ˛ailing a clerk
with an allegedly defective toasting fork from a
bar becue set. He managed to soothe the enraged
customer and to, retr ieve the lethal for k before any
real damage had been done – but it made him more
conscious than ever of Jim Preston™s absence.That
was the sort of hassle Press would have handled in
ten minutes; it was a good half-hour before D on got
back to Protec tion.
Sibyl was waiting for him. ﬁ We had a break.ﬂ
ﬁAbout time. What?ﬂ
ﬁBaisha Gates k nows the fur buyer at S ari S oeurs;
she™s certain she can get the list of their recent mink
customers; she™s gone r ight up there.ﬂ
88
ﬁM ay help.ﬂ He r i˙ed through the morning batch
of ˛yers from the Stores M utual Protec tive Associ
-
ation. Descr iptions of con˚r med k leptomaniacs,
amateur shoplifters and confessed boosters, of bag
snatchers and pickpockets who considered crowded
store aisles their happy hunting grounds, of hit-
and-run workers who calmly helped themselves to
gar ments o˜ the racks and straightaway strolled
out. But no ˛yers about jumpers or hijackers of sable
coats. ...
Sibyl said: ﬁAnd Baisha said you have an appoint
-
ment with Mor r is B erkowsk y at eleven-thirt y, his
oˆce.ﬂ
ﬁG ood.ﬂThe red button on the intercom winked
on and o˜ and on; the emergenc y signal.ﬁ Yes,
B eck y?ﬂ
ﬁM iss Stein is in Inter view,ﬂ his secretary said.ﬁI
think she needs help!ﬂ
I t was a dozen steps from his desk, through the
outer oˆce; he could hear the screaming before he
˛ung open the door.
Alice Stein™s chunky ˚gure was pinning a young
gir l in the cor ner beyond the heav y table.The
gir l ™s wrists were being held ˚rmly but, bet ween
screeches, she was biting at Alice™s neck and butting
her in the face.
D on reached over his operative™s shoulder, got a
gr ip on the gir l ™s hair, held her head back against the
wall.
ﬁ Watch her nails!ﬂ Alice warned.ﬁShe™s a slasher.
She ruined a couple hundred dollars™ worth of linge
-
r ie before they got wise to her. Broken razor blades
under her nails.ﬂ
89
She™s a handsome little hellion, Don thought.
Blond and slim and full of ˚zz and vinegar. Four teen,
maybe ˚fteen.
That beaver shor tie she™s wear ing set
some proud parent back quite a stack of coupons.
The gir l sneered.ﬁLingerie!Wait till you ˚nd out
what I did to those nylons. And if you want a real
laugh, take a look at those sevent y-˚ve - dollar croco
-
dile handbags!ﬂ
D on spoke over his shoulder.ﬁM iss Kahn. G et the
nurse down here.Tell her to br ing sedatives. I f the
doc tor ™s in the store, ask him to come along too.ﬂ
ﬁI don™t want any damned doctor,ﬂ the gir l cried.
ﬁ You can™t make me take any medicine. I won™t take
any!ﬂ
ﬁ You act,ﬂ D on said,ﬁas if you™ve already had
something.You been smoking reefers?ﬂ
ﬁSure.ﬂ She mocked him gleefully.ﬁI™m hopped
up till I™m ready to pop. But don™t ever think I™m not
responsible for my ac tions. I knew what I was doing
and I™ll do it again.ﬂ
D on let go of the blond hair.ﬁ Want ever ybody
to notice how bad you are, don™t you?What ™s the
matter?You™re good-looking enough to get all the
attention you want, without acting like a sulky six-
year- old. Who you tr ying to get even with?ﬂ
ﬁ You.ﬂ She showed nice even teeth in pure inso
-
lence.ﬁ You and ever ybody else in this crummy old
store.ﬂ
ﬁ What ™s your name?ﬂ he asked.
ﬁJane D oe. And I live in a whorehouse on West
For t y-sixth. Anything else you want to know?ﬂ
She began to laugh, rolling her head from side to
side with her eyes closed, the laughter coming in
90
crescendo bursts, louder and louder.
Alice said quietly:ﬁFaking. And she™s no addict,
D on.ﬂ
ﬁI k now she isn™t, Al. D oesn™t she have a
handbag?ﬂ
ﬁNo. M ay have a wallet in her coat.ﬂ
The laughter stopped suddenly.ﬁ Tr y and ˚nd it,ﬂ
the gir l panted.ﬁI live on what I make as a street
-
walker. I have no visible means of support; you™ll
have to arrest me and take me to cour t.ﬂ
The nurse bustled in starchily, regarded the gir l
amiably.
D on said: ﬁ Young lady fancies herself as a mali
-
cious bitch. She™s been slashing merchandise.
Want to be sure she doesn™t slash herself in a ˚t of
remorse, nurse.ﬂ
ﬁR emorse!ﬂ the gir l screeched hyster ically. ﬁM e ...
remorseful? How r idiculous can you be!ﬂ
The nurse scolded her.ﬁBehave, now. Sit down.
O ver there. Stop putting on an act. We™re used to
those shenanigans.ﬂ
Alice followed Don to the outer oˆce.ﬁS ome
-
thing screw y about her, D on. She comes from a good
family ... at least from a family with a good income.
You k now what I think? She wants to go to jail... to
hur t someone close to her.ﬂ
Sibyl peered in at the detainee.ﬁ You k now, I think
I™ve seen that k id ™s picture in the papers recentlyŠor
maybe in a magazine.ﬂ
D on said: ﬁS ee if you can ˚nd a cleaner™s mar k on
her clothes, Al.We™ll have to get in touch with her
folks.ﬂ He hated slashers as much as any store exec
-
utive, but Al and the nurse could handle that, time
91
being.
B eck y called: ﬁM ister Stolz on One.ﬂ
D on took it.ﬁ Yes, B ob.ﬂ
ﬁCouple of headquarters men on their way up to
see you, boy.ﬂ Stolz sounded grave.ﬁI passed the
buck to you because it™s about M yron Grolheim.ﬂ
ﬁ What about him?ﬂ
ﬁCop on the beat noticed his house had been
broken into. He called a prowl car.The detectives
went in and found a dead man on the kitchen ˛oor.ﬂ
92
## CHAPTER 14

**A DEAD MAN**

**DON™S KNUCKLESWHITENED ONTHE RECEIVER.**

They identify the dead man?ﬂ
ﬁD on™t believe so.ﬂ Stolz was wor r ied.ﬁI thought
of Jim Preston r ight away, of course. But I was afraid
I might cross you up by asking the wrong questions.ﬂ
ﬁ What did you say?ﬂ
ﬁOnly that Grolheim hadn™t showed up at the
store this morning, no one in the Fur S alon had
heard from him, so you were trying to locate him.
Nothing about the ... coat. Are you going to tell‚em
you were up there?ﬂ
ﬁD epends.ﬂ
I f the dead man was Press, I™ll have to
spill the whole stor y and to hell with secrec y. I f it was
M y Grolheim, it ™ll all have to come out, too; the chips
can fall where they may.
ﬁI™ll call you back , soon as I
can.ﬂ He hung up.
Sibyl breathed:ﬁA dead man, Don?ﬂ
ﬁCops saw that broken basement door, went
in, and found a body. If they made any identi˚ca
-
tion, they didn™t let on to B ob Stolz. Couple of the
93
Homicide crew are on their way up here now.ﬂ
She put a hand to her throat as if it hurt her to
speak . ﬁSuppose it was .. . Press.ﬂ
ﬁI have to make sure before I tell them about Max
and the gir l, about my having been up there.ﬂ
ﬁ They ™ll ˚nd it out, sooner or later.ﬂ Sibyl searched
his eyes. ﬁOur ˚nger pr ints will be all over the place.ﬂ
ﬁI f Press is dead, that won™t make any di˜erence.
We™ll have to get the machinery going to run down
M ax and his pals. No sense holding back anything ...
unless Press is still alive.ﬂ
ﬁBut if you stall and later on they learn you were
at Grolheim™sŠit™ll put you in a cor ner, Don.ﬂ
ﬁB oth of us ... in the same cor ner. That ™s r ight.You
want to take that gamble? It might have unpleasant
consequences, Sib.ﬂ
She was indignant.ﬁ You know better than to ask .ﬂ
ﬁ Thought I did.ﬂ He smiled tautly.
B eck y Kahn announced a Lieutenant Dimmock, a
S ergeant Quinton.
ﬁOne minute,ﬂ D on told the intercom.
Sibyl said: ﬁ Want me to stay?ﬂ
ﬁNo.Want you to get a line on Mister Norman
R ettjer.ﬂ
ﬁ The tycoon™s t ycoon?ﬂ She was sur pr ised. ﬁ The
pr incely giver?ﬂ
ﬁShot in the dark . He™s a fr iend of Bob Stolz.You
said the customer would be.ﬂ
ﬁ Yes. Also, he™d have that kind of money to ˛ing
around. And he™d be scared of scandal too.ﬂ
ﬁS ee if you can sni˜ out some. But sub rosa, Sib.ﬂ
ﬁS oul of discretion.ﬂ She went out.
Through the open oˆce door came a screech of
94
fur y from the slasher.ﬁYou can™t make me take any
of your damn medicine! I won™t take it!ﬂ
D on shook hands with Dimmock, a chesty mid
-
dle -aged detec tive whose blue serge seemed to be
buttoned around a bar rel. He had the suspicious
eyes and the hard, expressionless features of a man
accustomed to constant contac t with deception. The
eyes inspected D on™s bruised countenance; the lieu
-
tenant ™s face remained impassive.
Q uinton, on the other hand, looked like a rangy,
young executive in some prosperous advertising
agenc y; he was suave and a˜able in the best Madi
-
son Avenue manner.
Dimmock got right down to business.ﬁ Your man
-
ager says you™re anxious to get in touch with this
M ister Grolheim. Expect we™re even more concer ned
than you are.We want to ask him about a dead man
found in his house this morning.ﬂ
D on said: ﬁ You sure it wasn™t Grolheim you
found?ﬂ
Q uinton answered.ﬁG entleman we talked to
downstairs says your fur buyer is a small man, mid
-
dle -aged, dar k hair, dark complexion. Right?ﬂ
ﬁ That ™s right ﬂ D on nodded.ﬁ What did the dead
man look like?ﬂ
ﬁLike he™d been picked on by a pile driver,ﬂ Dim
-
mock said. ﬁFace beat in. Hell of a mess. Now about
this Grolheim, Mister Stolz said you might have a
photograph.ﬂ
D on spoke to the intercom.ﬁM ister Grolheim™s
Con˚dential folder, please, M iss K ahn.ﬂ He tur ned to
Dimmock . ﬁFrom what I k now of Myron Grolheim, he
wouldn™t have the strength or the stamina to beat
95
up a schoolboy. How old would you say the victim
was?ﬂ
Q uinton smiled skeptically.ﬁB e sur prised what
a little man can do if he gets mad enough, Mister
Cadee.We had a case, only couple weeks ago. Old
boy in his sixties, wouldn™t have weighed more™n a
hundred-twent y in a diving suit, took a hammer to
a moving man come to take back some installment
fur niture. Fella looked like he™d been kicked in the
teeth by a mule.ﬂ
B eck y came in with the folder ; a shrill scream
from the Inter view R oom came in with her. The
Homicide men exchanged cur ious glances.
D on handed the folder across the desk to Dim
-
mock .ﬁYou™ll see by the physical descr iption that
M ister Grolheim wouldn™t have been able to put up
much of a battle with a man who was heavier than
he was. Did this dead man have a muscular build?ﬂ
ﬁ Yeah,ﬂ Dimmock said o˜handedly.ﬁ With this
descr ip, we™ll have enough to put out a pickup ˛yer
on Grolheim. You got any dope on his relatives,
fr iends?ﬂ
D on spread his hands.ﬁI have the records of more
than t wo thousand employees of Ambletts in those
˚les, Lieutenant.You can see it would be impossi
-
ble for us to keep tabs on all of them.ﬂ
Why are you
holding out on me? Is it because somebody saw me
leaving the West End house with Sib this morning and
you want me to commit myself?
Q uinton said: ﬁ We don™t expect the impossible,
M ister Cadee. But we thought you might be able to
suggest some reason for your fur buyer ™s absence.ﬂ
D on said carefully : ﬁI saw him for a few minutes
96
yesterday after noon. As far as I know, he expected to
be in this morning. His assistant, Miss G ates, looked
for him as usual. H is record here has been tops; he™s
been in responsible positions with leading stores for
years. Not the sort to run out on his company.ﬂ
ﬁM iddle -aged menﬂŠ Q uinton shook his head
amiablyŠﬂdo some peculiar things. Glandular dis
-
tur bances, you k now.We had a caseŠﬂ
Dimmock broke in shar ply. ﬁ Think you ought to
k now that the gentleman has taken all his clothingŠ
suits, shirts, the wor ksŠfrom his house. Sor t of thing
a man does when he™s planning to sk ip the locality.
M akes it hard for us to enter tain any suggestion of
self-defense. Now if he™d stayed put after the battle
he had with this boy, if he™d called the precinc t and
asked for a couple of oˆcers to come overŠthere™d
been a ˚ght and the kid was deadŠwhy, we™d
be able to book him on manslaughter instead of
murder.ﬂ
ﬁB oy?ﬂ Don tr ied to keep the monosyllable from
disclosing his feelings.
Q uinton answered quick ly. ﬁPrett y hard to pin
down his age until we get the med-exam™s report,
you k now. Fifteen, possibly sixteen. Did Mister
Grolheim have a car?ﬂ
ﬁA green and brown Pontiac station wagon, late
model.ﬂ
I t was Max, not Press! Max, who nearly beat
you to death. The little bastard who would have k illed
you if it hadn™t been for the girl in the turquoise dress.
A sense of relief ˛ooded over him.
Dimmock said: ﬁ Then Grolheim wouldn™t have
been likely to be hiring a chau˜eur? This dead kid
had on a chau˜eur ™s unifor m.ﬂ
97
ﬁI wouldn™t know, of course,ﬂ Don said cautiously,
ﬁ but Mister Grolheim didn™t seem to me like the lim
-
ousine type.ﬂ
Q uinton took the folder from Dimmock, scanned
it swiftly.ﬁ Was your fur buyer especially interested in
young boys?ﬂ
D on kept his temper. ﬁOnly in his son who is in
a military academy, I believe. A ver y normal guy,
M ister Grolheim, in my opinion. Could this youngster
have been a burglar, perhaps?ﬂ
ﬁSure,ﬂ Dimmock said.ﬁHe could have been. It
still doesn™t explain why a householder who sur
-
pr ised a thief and battered him to death should clear
out without notifying the authorities.ﬂ
Q uinton tucked the folder under his arm. ﬁ There™ll
be something more to it than burglar y, you can bet
on that, Mister Cadee. We™ll have the answer within
t went y-four hours, you can bet on that, too.ﬂ
Dimmock said: ﬁM eantime you™ll keep in touch
with us, Mister Cadee? If you hear from your fur
buyer, I mean.ﬂ
ﬁSure,ﬂ Don said.ﬁExcuse me.ﬂThe red button on
the intercom glowed on, o˜, on, o˜, on again.
ﬁ Yes, Miss K ahn.ﬂ
ﬁUh – call for you onTwo,ﬂ his secretar y mur
-
mured.ﬁI don™t k now whether you want to talk to
him, now.ﬂ
ﬁPut him on.ﬂ He k new whose voice he would
hear when he picked up the phone and he wasn™t
disappointed.

**DEAD OR ALIVE?**

receiver against his ear. ﬁHow you doing, fella?ﬂ
ﬁAll r ight, so far,ﬂ Grolheim said calmly.ﬁI just
wanted to let you k now that the Lily I nez will go back
to town this evening.ﬂ
ﬁ That ™s ˚ne, ˚ne.ﬂ No mistaking the timbre of the
buyer ™s voice; still, there was something decidedly
queer about Grolheim™s way of talking, Don thought.
I t was almost as if the man had dictated to a tape
recording device. But of course that couldn™t be,
since Grolheim was replying to the remar ks made to
him.ﬁYou™ll be coming too?ﬂ
ﬁNot r ight away, D on. Not until tomorrow, prob
-
ably. Better have Miss G ates get those Fur Festival
proofs out of my top drawer and okay them.They
have to be in today.ﬂThe buyer was as matter-of-fac t
as if the past four teen hours had been a blank slate.
ﬁI™ll take care of that.ﬂ Don could see Dimmock™s
head cocked slightly to one side, straining to hear
the other half of the phone conversation. The
99
lieutenant was suspicious; it wouldn™t be smart to
ask direct questions but there was one query which
had to be putŠ guardedly. ﬁHow ™s Jim mak ing out,
boy?ﬂ
Grolheim™s tone became fainter, as if he had
moved back from the transmitter. ﬁOh ... I nearly
forgot to tell youŠhe™s going in with the sables.
M ight let his wife know.ﬂ
ﬁI™ll do that.ﬂ D on felt perspiration on his fore
-
head, k new Dimmock had noticed it, was wondering
why D on was sweating blood. He couldn™t gain much
by continuing this restrained double-talk; still he
had the feeling that Grolheim was struggling to get
through with something more coherent than the
casual conversation had provided up to now.ﬁAbout
what time, should I tell, her?ﬂ
ﬁ Well... I can™t say . – probablyŠ oh, sometime
af ter the rehearsal is over.ﬂThe buyer was plainly
confused. ﬁEleven or so. Something like that.Well,
see you tomor row, Don.ﬂThere was an abrupt click.
D on waited a moment before hanging up. ﬁ Take it
easy, boy,ﬂ he said to the dead line. He couldn™t let it
seem as if he™d been cut o˜ cold.ﬁS orr y for the inter
-
ruption, gentlemen.ﬂ
Q uinton was speak ing almost before he™d racked
the receiver.ﬁ This GrolheimŠis he separated from
his wife?ﬂ
D on said: ﬁHe™s a widower; it ™s there in the ˚le.
Why?ﬂ
The sergeant smiled.ﬁ We have reason to believe
there was a woman in the house at the time the
cr ime was committed.ﬂ
Reason? What kind of reason? What had they found
100
up there on West End?Traces of face powder? A cop
-
per y hair? Had Sibyl left a handkerchief?
ﬁM aybe the
woman wasn™t with Mister Grolheim. Couldn™t she
have been with this youngster who was killed?ﬂ
ﬁ Yeah,ﬂ Lieutenant Dimmock said sourly. ﬁShe
could have been the one who pounded him to a
pulp, all we k now.ﬂ He stared with open hostility.
ﬁ You wouldn™t be giving us any run-around, trying to
keep your store out of the papers, Mister Cadee? If
you had any news about this Grolheim you wouldn™t
hold it back now, would you?ﬂ
D on put on a prop scowl of resentment. ﬁI f you
have any doubts about the way Ambletts cooperates
with the police, ask your precinc t captain; he™ll tell
you we play ball. Howeverﬂ Šhe slapped the blotter
gently with the ˛at of bis handŠﬂyou can under
-
stand that the store wouldn™t like to have one of our
executives accused of murder until he™s at least had
a chance to defend himself against the charge.We
back up our people until we ˚nd there™s good reason
not to, Lieutenant ﬂ
ﬁBack‚em up all you want,ﬂ Dimmock growled.
ﬁJust don™t buck us.ﬂ
ﬁOn the contrar y,ﬂ D on said, ﬁI™ll help all I can. Go
down to the morgue with you r ight now, see if I can
identify this kid – ?ﬂ
ﬁ You couldn™t.ﬂ Q uinton waved the o˜er aside.
ﬁFeatures were mutilated too much; his own father
wouldn™t recognize him.We™ll have to wor k from ˚n
-
ger pr ints, dental charts, clothing, see?ﬂ
Dimmock stalked toward the door.ﬁ Where™ll we
˚nd this assistant of Grolheim™s?ﬂ
ﬁM iss Gates may be out of the store.ﬂ Don went to
101
the outer oˆce with them. ﬁM iss K ahn, see if you can
get hold of Baisha Gates.These gentlemen want to
talk to her.ﬂ
S ergeant Quinton shook hands.ﬁ We™ll have to tell
your switchboard gir ls to hold up any outside calls
from M ister Grolheim until they can be traced.ﬂ
ﬁG ood idea,ﬂ D on said evenly.ﬁI was going to do
that, myself.ﬂ
M iss Kahn repor ted that M iss G ates was out of the
store, wasn™t expec ted back until af ter lunch.
Dimmock grunted.ﬁLeave word we™ll be in to see
her.ﬂ He turned to D on. ﬁSure there isn™t anything
you™d like to add to what you™ve told us, before we
send in our repor t to the Prosecutor ™s oˆce?ﬂ
ﬁ What could I add,ﬂ D on said,ﬁexcept that those
of us who knew M ister Grolheim can™t believe he™d
be guilty of any cr ime?ﬂ
The lieutenant stalked toward the cor r idor, spoke
over his shoulder:ﬁ We™ll drop in again this afternoon
on the chance you may have thought of something.ﬂ
B eck y Kahn waited until they were well out of
hear ing: ﬁI hope I did the right thing, putting that call
through ... ?ﬂ
ﬁR ight as rain, B ecky.ﬂ He patted her shoulder
with more reassurance than he felt.ﬁS ee if you can
get M ister Stolz for me.ﬂ
He decided not to tell Bob about the call from
Grolheim just yet.Time enough for that af ter the
crown sable had been returned, if it was going to be;
af ter Jim Preston had shown up, if that was what
Grolheim had meant.
But there was a reser vation about that in Don™s
mind.The buyer hadn™t said Press was all r ight, only
102
that he was coming in with the crown sable coat.
D ead or alive?
Even if the doorman at the Buckinghurst and
S alvatore had been wrong about the disappear
-
ance of old Jim, even supposing the implication
of the heaviness of the amber- colored box didn™t
mean what D on thought it meant, stillŠthere was
no longer any doubt that both Press and Grolheim
were in the hands of murderers. I f they had killed
M ax, expecting to lay the cr ime on Grolheim, they
might just as easily have put Press out of the way,
with the intention of shifting the blame for that onto
Grolheim, too.
The red eye glowed.ﬁB ob? Our fr iends have gone.
D emised part y tur ns out to be the juvenile delin
-
quent who nearly bashed out my brains.ﬂ
ﬁOh? S o? Well, relieved to k now it wasn™t Jim
Preston.ﬂ
ﬁS o™m I. Still leaves Grolheim with his tail in a
crack , though.ﬂ
ﬁHow‚ bout you? D o they know you had a run-in
with this kid?ﬂ
ﬁNo. M aybe I should have told them, but I didn™t.
Keeping my ˚ngers crossed for Press.ﬂ
ﬁM ight get yourself in trouble.Want to be damn
careful.ﬂ
ﬁI am being. S ome fat™s in the ˚re already. Can™t
keep that from spatter ing onto the front pages. But
I™ll do my best to see it doesn™t bur n any innocent
bystanders.ﬂ
ﬁK now you will, D on. Keep me in touch. I™m god
-
damn upset about this.ﬂ
Who isn™t?
D on retorted silently as he hung up.
103
Only person who doesn™t seem to be bothered is M y
Grolheim. Have we all misjudged the little man?
He rejected the possibility that the buyer had
been responsible for Max ™s death. Whatever might be
concealed beneath Grolheim™s gloominess, his ner
-
vous apprehensions, his apparent nonchalance on
the telephone, the man was not the homicidal type.
From what he had seen of the gir l in the turquoise
dress, she hadn™t appeared to be the sort who would
have battered a boy ™s face so it resembled nothing
human.
Unless there were still other members of the
hijack gang, that left only the man with the nasty
smile Salvatore had described. He™d have been with
Grolheim during that phone call just now. Would,
even before that, have known all he needed to k now
from the contents of the wallet Max had taken with
D on™s clothes.
ﬁ Want to be damn careful!ﬂ Not much need of that
war ning! Not with a probable murderer in possession
of keys to the store, your oˆce, your hotel room, your
car. ...
B eck y drove in on his thoughts.ﬁM iss Stein says
she has to see you r ight away.ﬂ
ﬁB e r ight out.ﬂ
Alice Stein stood by his secretary ™s desk , a hand
-
kerchief pressed to her ear.ﬁ We™ll have to get that
hellcat out of here, Mister Cadee. She™s prac tically
clawed the nurse™s eyes out I can™t ˚gure what™s
eating her but she ought to be in a strait jacket.ﬂ
ﬁM aybe we™ll have to put her there, Al.ﬂ He went in
the I nter view R oom.
The gir l sat panting in the straight-backed chair;
104
the nurse gr ipped the gir l ™s crossed wrists behind the
chair back.
ﬁHa!ﬂ the prisoner sneered.ﬁ Where™s your hand
-
cu˜s, mister? Or did you bring a rope to tie me? Why
don™t you have me ar restedŠwhy don™t you?ﬂ
D on said: ﬁ We™re going to, young lady. But it may
not be quite as big a thrill as you seem to think.ﬂ
ﬁG o on. Send me to jail.ﬂThe gir l laughed inso
-
lently.ﬁI don™t mind going to jail. Not so long as they
take me into cour t af ter wards.ﬂ
That ™s what she™s af ter. A chance to cause a sen
-
sation in cour t, probably hoping to disgrace her
parents or maybe to get even with a boy fr iend.
ﬁI t
may be quite a while before you get to cour t,ﬂ he said
sober ly.ﬁWe™re not even going to have you charged
with malicious mischief for a while.You™re going to
a psychiatric ward for observation; you™re as close
to being unbalanced as anyone I™ve seen for some
time.ﬂ
The insolence lef t the gir l ™s eyes; the sneer van
-
ished from her lips.ﬁA loony bin?ﬂ She cringed.ﬁ You
can™t put me in a craz y house!ﬂ Her voice lost its
shr illness. ﬁ You can™t!ﬂ
The nurse breathed heavily.ﬁ That ™s where you
belong, miss.Wet packs and restraining sheets.ﬂ
ﬁNo!ﬂThe gir l bit her upper lip ˚ercely.ﬁ You can™t
do that. Not without my parents™ per mission. You
can™t!ﬂ
D on frowned.ﬁ We don™t k now who your parents
are. I f you want to tell us – ?ﬂ
The gir l glared up at him. ﬁNo!ﬂ she snarled.ﬁNo, I
won™t tell you!You can do what you want to me but I
won™t tell and you can all go to hell!ﬂ

from the precinc t had taken the gir l to B ellevue;
Alice Stein was listening to the explanations of an
indignant dowager who had been apprehended
whileﬁsimply taking the garment out to the street so
she could see how it looked in daylightﬂ; Protec tion
was settling down to its daily procession of amateur
pilferers and professional boosters.The show did
not diver t D on™s attention from the curious problem
of M y Grolheim™s implausible attitude.
Just now, on the phone, the buyer hadn™t seemed
at all concer ned about his own precar ious situation.
Yet less than twent y-four hours ago he had acted
like a man genuinely alarmed for his own safet y. But
yesterday he had been in no actual danger, while
today he must cer tainly have realized his peril. Had
he been so numbed by the hijacking, the attack on
Press, the death of M ax that he could no longer think
106
clear ly? It seemed improbable.
The intercom announced M iss Forde on One.
ﬁHello,ﬂ he said.ﬁ You™ll be glad to know the guy
the cops found up onWest End wasn™t Press.ﬂ
ﬁI t ™s a black dog o˜ my back,ﬂ Sibyl said.ﬁ Who
was he?ﬂ
ﬁ Teenage tor pedo who wor ked me over. Some
-
body had wor ked on him, with more permanent
results.ﬂ
ﬁPolice k now you were up there, D on?ﬂ
ﬁNot yet No. I t would have required too much
explanation.ﬂ
ﬁStill will.You™re only postponing the evil hour.ﬂ
ﬁI f I can postpone it until tomor row it may tur n
the tr ick. Just had a queer chat with Grolheim on the
phone. He claims ever ything will be straightened out
by then.ﬂ
ﬁB y then that coat could be in Rio.ﬂ
ﬁAnd Press might be in hisŠﬂ
ﬁD on™t say it!ﬂ she cut in sharply.ﬁSpeaking of
those crown sables, your shot in the dark may have
hit the mark .ﬂ
ﬁCredit our Gee Em for the aiming.What did you
pick up?ﬂ
ﬁG eo˜rey Ruiz, the syndicated tattler. Just had
co˜ee schlagober with him at his apar tment.ﬂ
ﬁH m.You have to go that far for the information?ﬂ
ﬁD on™t worr y. G eo˜ ™s only a˜air is with his gossip
column. He goes for ˛atter y the way I went for that
whipped cream. He admitted there were whisperings
in so -so-societ y circles about Miss I. and Mister R.ﬂ
ﬁSuch as – ?ﬂ
ﬁI tem: when she made that
M agni˚cent Hussy

107
pic ture in Venice last summer, he just happened to
spend weekends at the Lido. O f course it™s no sin to
be seen sun-bathing together. –ﬂ
ﬁNo. S o?ﬂ
ﬁI tem: couple weeks ago she ˛ew toVegas for
some guest shots at one of those cushy caravanse
-
raisŠ guess who tur ned up next to her at the roulette
tables ever y night?ﬂ
ﬁHe™d be a handy man to have around when the
chips are down.ﬂ
ﬁOne of his companies buys the commercial spots
on the last half of her show. He™s always in the spon
-
sors™ booth but never brings his wife.ﬂ
ﬁD oesn™t he have any competition?ﬂ
ﬁNothing else but. Dimpled darling goes out with
more celebrated spenders than the columnists can
keep track of. Cattle barons from the Argentine,
French movie stars, last week one of those ruby-r ich
maharajas. She™s never seen with Mister R. in public.
But then, as Geo˜ points out, the most interesting
tête -à-têtes are seldom in public. And, by the bye, he
owns the Buckinghurst.ﬂ
ﬁConvenient for all concer ned.ﬂ He considered
the possibilities.ﬁNice, snug job of rounding up the
rumors, chum. Now why don™t you go home, catch a
quick nap? You didn™t get any sleep to speak of– .ﬂ
ﬁNeither did you, unless you count the time you
were unconscious. Anyhow I couldn™t rest until I
k new for sure about Press. I™m going to scout around
the exclusive shops to see if I can get a line on that
turquoise gown. And if I do get a lead, where will I
˚nd you?ﬂ
ﬁHow about the Red B oar, one o™clock?ﬂ
108
ﬁAt the bar,ﬂ she agreed. ﬁI™ll need another pickup
by then.ﬂ
He gave Beck y the number he™d seen on the
gold receiver at Lily Inez ™s apar tment.The maid
answered.
ﬁ This is Cadee of Ambletts. Let me speak to M iss
I nez.ﬂ
ﬁShe is not here. She is at the rehearsal.ﬂ
ﬁ What studio is that, Frances?ﬂ
The maid hesitated.ﬁ Twenty Em. But you cannot
call her there. She will not be disturbed.You may
leave a message with me, if you wish.ﬂ
ﬁM aybe later, thanks.ﬂ He put on his topcoat, told
B eck y where he was going, adjusted his hat so the
band didn™t press too tightly over the swollen eye.
At the Inter view R oom he paused only long
enough to wigwag Alice that she was to take over at
his desk. He thought of getting her to caution Baisha
G ates about Dimmock and Quinton but decided
there would be plenty of time for that before the
Homicide men retur ned.
He walked to the telecasting building, found the
big studio, ran into a uniformed usher at the door.
ﬁNo visitors, mister.ﬂ
ﬁI have a message for M iss Inez,ﬂ Don said.
ﬁLeave it with me. I™ll see she gets it. But you can™t
come in.ﬂ
D on took out a business card, wroteﬁAbout Mr.
R.ﬂ on it, held it out. ﬁHow much do you want to bet I
can™t come in, if you get that to her r ight away?ﬂ
The usher glanced around to make sure no one
was watching.ﬁ You™re not one of those lousy process
ser vers, are you?ﬂ
109
ﬁShe™ll tell you I™m not.ﬂ Don ˚ngered his wallet
ﬁB et you ˚ve she tells you to br ing me in.ﬂ He pulled
the ˚ve halfway out of the billfold section.
The usher made a movement as if to push away
the bribe.ﬁI guess you can go in.ﬂ He slid his closed
˚st into his pocket ﬁJust don™t say I let you through.ﬂ
D on strolled into the noisy confusion of re˛ec tors,
cameras, lights, microphone boomsŠpicked his
way over snaking cables, through a crowd of shirt-
sleeved technicians, toward a trio of sets at the far
end of the studio. A dozen people clustered around
a long table where a young man in horn r ims and a
houndstooth jacket was dealing out pages o˜ a pile
of papers.
ﬁNew pages eleven, twelve, k iddies.Tur n in your
old pages, get your revisions. G oing to run through it
in a minute.ﬂ
D on spoke to the assistant direc tor at the table.
ﬁ Where can I ˚nd Miss Inez?ﬂ
ﬁ You can™t.ﬂThe other continued to hand out
scr ipt pages.ﬁCouldn™t ˚nd her myself. Just tried.ﬂ
D on put his hand on the assistant director ™s
shoulder. ﬁIs M ister Hadley here?ﬂ
The hor n rims looked up at him owlishly.ﬁ Who™re
you?ﬂ
ﬁName is Cadee. M ister Hadley knows me.ﬂ
ﬁPast that set.Through the little door.Tur n left.
O ˆce there.ﬂ
D on followed direc tions, ˚led past a queue
of musicians retur ning from a break .There were
three men in the oˆce. One hammered at a type
-
wr iter. Another leaned over his shoulder.The third
was Hadley; he sat hunched low in a swivel chair,
110
cradling a phone on his chest, ˛utter ing one of
the childish hands as he talked. H is eyes tur ned
mechanically toward D on; it was a moment before
recognition was complete.Then Hadley set the
phone on its rack .
ﬁFor godsake, what happened to you, my friend?ﬂ
ﬁR an into a bit of trouble about that bir thday
present.ﬂ As far as D on could tell, neither of the
others noticed the interruption.ﬁ Want to make sure
M iss Inez doesn™t run into the same k ind. Have to
talk to her right away.ﬂ
Hadley put an arm around Don™s shoulders, drew
him out of the oˆce.ﬁMean to say you were actually
attacked?ﬂ He looked as if he was on the verge of a
sneeze.
ﬁB y one of the team that hijacked those crown
sables, yes.ﬂ
ﬁ YouŠtracked them down?ﬂ
ﬁNot exactly. I™m not the only one in on the track
-
ing down, either. Police are involved now.ﬂ
ﬁNo!ﬂ Hadley was clearly shocked; he dropped bis
ar m.ﬂBut you promisedŠﬂ
ﬁI didn™t bring them into it,ﬂ D on said.ﬁAnd so
far the cops don™t k now Miss I nez is mixed up in the
mess. But they™re bound to ˚nd out.You can™t soft-
pedal a murder.ﬂ
ﬁ You – uh – said murder?ﬂ The pink washed out
of Elton Hadley™s face as if a gray shadow had fallen
over the high forehead.ﬁ Who – ?ﬂ
ﬁLook ,ﬂ D on said impatiently,ﬁ last night I tr ied
to get Miss I nez to tell me what she knew about this
crown sable business; she might have prevented a
k illing if she hadn™t dumbed up. Now I™m not going
111
to horse around with her any longer. Either she talks
to me here and now, or to the police this after noon.ﬂ
Hadley swallowed before he answered.ﬁFr iend,
you have her all wrong. Lil wasn™t dumbing up. She
was scared to death.That ™s the fact. She™ll tell you
why. Come on. I™ll take you to her.ﬂ

tur ned a cor ner, led the way up a short ˛ight, down a
wide hall past a picture -windowed booth with tiered
theater seats like a projection room overlook ing
the confusion of apparatus, the chur ning activit y
on the studio ˛oor below. Across the hall from this
obser vation booth was a narrow door with a red-
lettered war ning:
**MAINTENANCEŠKEEP OUT.**

Hadley rapped on it.
ﬁHad to have her dressing room switched up
here,ﬂ he started to explain. ﬁLast week we had a
disagreeableŠﬂ
The door opened suddenly. Lily Inez, youthful in
white tailored shir t and tight black skir t, gazed in
astonishment. ﬁ Why, M ister Cadee! You™ve been in an
accident!ﬂ
113
ﬁNothing accidental, no.ﬂ D on took in the scant y
fur nishings of the temporar y dressing roomŠ
make -up table with mirrors and a clutter of jars, a
chaise, a small co˜ee table with an electr ic espresso
machine, some chairs such as undertakers use.ﬁI
took a beating, M iss Inez.Tr ying to ˚nd out who
stole your sables.ﬂ
ﬁOh, G od!ﬂ She registered instant sympathy. ﬁI™m
so fr ightfully sor r y.ﬂ
ﬁS or r y?ﬂ he repeated dourly.ﬁ That ™s hardly
enough.ﬂ
ﬁO ur fr iend is sore, Lil.ﬂ Hadley closed the door,
put one foot up on a folding chair, crossed his arms,
and rested them on his knee.ﬁHe thinks you held
out on him last night, that if you™d spoken up then
you might have prevented a lulling.ﬂ
ﬁAh!ﬂ she exclaimed.ﬁ Who was killed?ﬂ
ﬁPolice haven™t made an identi˚cation yet.ﬂ Don
wondered whether her shocked expression was the
-
atr ical or genuine.ﬁBody ™s down at the morgue. But I
had a prett y good look at him. Also, Mister Grolheim
descr ibed him to me yesterday af ter noon.ﬂ
She ˚ddled nervously with a cigarette while he
gave details of his visit to the fur buyer ™s home, the
encounter with M ax. He didn™t mention the gir l in the
turquoise gown.ﬁBastard had buck teeth and pale
green eyes and sidebur ns; his skin was bad and his
talk was tough. R ecognize him?ﬂ
ﬁNo.ﬂ She glanced up at Hadley as if for con˚r
-
mation.ﬁSounds as if he was a per fec tly hideous
monster. I don™t believe I™d ever be able to forget
anyone so horr ible ... if I™d ever seen him.ﬂ
ﬁ Thing isﬂŠHadley waggled plump little
114
˚ngersŠﬁthe cops have seen him. They ™re sure to
˚nd out he was one of those who hijacked the coat;
then they™ll want to know why you didn™t report the
thef t last night.You better set Mister Cadee straight,
or I wouldn™t blame him for thinking you k now a lot
more about it than you actually do.ﬂ
ﬁ What I think ﬂŠDon was impatientŠﬁis that you™d
better realize there™s a lot more at stake than any
fanc y fur piece.Two of Ambletts™ men are still in the
hands of a gang that doesn™t balk at anything in the
book .ﬂ
Lily Inez put her hand on Hadley™s sleeve.ﬁElton
– you™ll have to tell them I feel too wretched to run
through the script this morning. I simply could not
make it.ﬂ
ﬁI ˚x.ﬂ Hadley looked unhappy.ﬁI t ™ll mean over
-
time tonight. But you™re in no shape to rehearse.ﬂ
He went to the door.ﬁDon™t forget to take your ten-
thir ty pill.ﬂ
ﬁAll r ight.ﬂ She rose to lock the door behind him.
ﬁI feel as if I™ve been rehearsing a nightmare for the
last ten days. I™m closer to a crack-up than an egg
that just rolled o˜ the table.ﬂ She shook a small
pink tablet from a plastic phial. ﬁA nightmare all
day every day and no sleep at night. I wish to Christ
I™d never heard of the damn sables.ﬂ She sat on the
bench before the glitter ing make -up mirrors.
ﬁD oes the gentleman who bought the coat k now
how you feel about it?ﬂ Don asked.
ﬁOh yes.ﬂ Lily Inez popped the pill into her mouth,
poured a chaser from a thermos jug.ﬁBut he™s not
the sort to back down on a promise. And up to last
night he thought the rhymes were the wor k of some
115
for mer admirer who was jealous of him.ﬂ She smiled
wr yly at her re˛ec tion, tilting her chin up to examine
a throat shadow, reciting meanwhile:
ﬁ The day you wear the sable coat
I promise I will cut your throat.ﬂ
ﬁ Who sent the comic valentine?ﬂ
She t wisted around on the bench to frown at him.
ﬁI thought at ˚rst it was a joke, too, when it came
in the mail ten days ago. But then I began to puzzle
it outŠup to then no one but my fr iend and I knew
anything about this wonderful present ... no one at
all. He hadn™t told a soul, nor had I. Not even Elton
. .. though he handles all my personal business, my
bank account, my mail, everything.The coat was
to be an absolute secret until my bir thdayŠyester
-
day. But it wasn™t a secret; the person who wrote
that miserable jingle knew. I t wor r ied me; I simply
couldn™t imagine anyone who™d make an ugly threat
like that.ﬂ
D on said: ﬁ The generous gentleman had no idea?ﬂ
ﬁHe k new he couldn™t have let the cat out of the
bag so he was sure I must have. I couldn™t convince
him otherwise. But of course I was absolutely pos
-
itive I hadn™t breathed the slightest suggestion to
anyone Šso I was cer tain he must somehow have
let the secret slip.We batted that back and for th the
whole of a distressing evening – and got nowhere.
I dreamed of stilettos and butcher k nives all night
I n the morning I was so exhausted I could laugh at
myself. But when I got a call from Elton at the studio
I stopped laughing.ﬂ She massaged her temples with
116
the tips of her ˚ngers. ﬁ The second r hyme had been
sent to me in care of the television networ k mar ked
‚Pr ivate and Personal.™ I t had been put in with the
batch of fan letters and Elton, who takes the fan mail
ser iously, had opened it.ﬂ She chanted the words in a
depressed tone of voice:
ﬁOnce wear the sable that he gave
And then get ready for your grave.ﬂ
ﬁHadley have any suggestion who the rhymester
might be?ﬂ
ﬁNo indeed. He thought it was some crackpot
because of course he didn™t know anything about
the coat. But then I had to tell him. It began to get
him upset, too ... and he has the occupational dis
-
ease of the television business, ulcers. It was almost
more of a strain on him than on me, with those nasty
couplets coming in ever y day like clockwor k .
ﬁBut don that gar ment once and I
Will guarantee that you will die.ﬂ
ﬁ Were these things handwritten?ﬂ
She reached for an ostr ich leather bag on the
chaise, opened it, took out a check wallet, from
beneath the pad of checks removed a folded sheet.
ﬁ This is the last one; day before yesterday.ﬂ
I t was neatly t yped in the center of a sheet of
coarse white paper, letter head size:
Let your conscience be your guide
And be not the coˆn™s bride.
117
He ˚ngered the paper thoughtfully. ﬁ You haven™t
made any attempt to trace this?ﬂ
ﬁHow could we?There are good reasons why my
fr iend does not want any publicity and just as many
why it should hurt me professionally.ﬂ She gestured
at the paper.ﬁI t ™s written on studio paperŠit ™s made
especially so it won™t make crack ling noises when
you rustle it near a mike. But almost anyone could
get hold of a few sheets like that.ﬂ
ﬁ What about the envelopes?ﬂ
ﬁ They ™re at home. I kept them all. Plain, dime-
store var iety.ﬂ She held out her hand for the jingle. ﬁI
k now you™re supposed to be able to trace a thing like
this from the typewriting. He wanted to get a ˚rm
of pr ivate detec tives on it but I wouldn™t let him; the
whole thing has made me so desperately miserable.
All my life I™ve been ˚ghting for something I never
thought I™d have, absolute secur it y. Maybe you don™t
k now it but there aren™t too many in show business
who do get it. A big salary, yesŠbut you have to cut
it up six ways from Sunday and few of us put enough
away to feel safe, no matter if the options aren™t
picked up.There™s always that fear of being old and
sick and alone in some cheap rooming house.ﬂ Her
eyes closed.ﬁI really thought I had it made this time.
I even thought I might get that jack pot bonus along
with it, genuine happiness with someone I honestly
care for. But I guess it™s not in the cards for me. I told
him last night that if it hadn™t been for the possibility
your store people might have been hurt, I™d be glad
the damn coat had been stolen. I meant it.ﬂ
ﬁI t ™s to be retur ned tonight, M iss Inez.ﬂ
She gasped.ﬁ To me?ﬂ
118
ﬁI suppose. M ister Grolheim phoned to say it
would be brought back sometime late this evening.ﬂ
ﬁButŠthen why did they steal it?ﬂ
ﬁFor money. Only thing that sor t of thug steals
f o r .ﬂ
ﬁ Who would pay them?ﬂ
ﬁ Your Mister R ettjer.ﬂ
ﬁNo!ﬂ She came to her feet.ﬁHe™d never do a thing
like that!ﬂ
ﬁS omebody™s going to pay, if the crown sables
come back. I t doesn™t seem as if you™d be interested
in putting up the money.Who besides Mister R ettjer
would you suggest?ﬂ
She sat down suddenly as if she was faint.ﬁHe
doesn™t k now about the murder. I t would almost
make him a part y to the crime, wouldn™t it?ﬂ
ﬁCompounding a felony, it ™s called.Yes. I don™t
care about that. I™m not a cop. But if M ister R ettjer
has made a deal with these hijackers, he™ll have
made ar rangements to get the money to them
before the coat is tur ned over. I want to k now what
those arrangements are and I want to k now in a
hur r y.You better get hold of your fr iend and ˚nd
out.ﬂ

hair.ﬁHow did you ˚nd out about Norman?ﬂ
ﬁ There™s been talk about his being in Las Vegas
while you were there.ﬂ
She made a comical moue.ﬁI told him it was a
mistake for him to go out there.ﬂ
ﬁI t ™ll be your mistake if you don™t call him now.ﬂ
ﬁ There™s a phone booth up on the next ˛oor.ﬂ
ﬁ Think of all the raised eyebrows if I were to be
seen crowding into a public booth with you. And I
have to hear what you say to him.ﬂ
ﬁI™m sure you wouldn™t crowd me, Mister Cadee.ﬂ
ﬁI might have to,ﬂ he said soberly.ﬁ There™s a
phone in that sponsor™s booth across the hall.ﬂ
ﬁHe doesn™t like me to call him at the oˆce.ﬂ
ﬁI won™t like it if you don™t. Tell him I have to see
him r ight away.ﬂ
She laid the comb down reluctantly.ﬁI hate to
do anything that might get him in trouble, M ister
120
Cadee.ﬂ
ﬁHe™s in trouble up to his ears already if he™s made
a deal with these hijackers.You and I may be able to
keep him from getting in deeper.ﬂ
ﬁ Then I™ll try to get him to see you.ﬂ
The phone was on a low table in front of the ˚rst
row of seats in the steeply tiered booth. The only
light in the darkened cubicle came from the great
glass window look ing down on the bustling activit y
of the studio. Elec tricians trailed coils of cable to
and fro, sport-shir ted cameramen made myster ious
adjustments with their cumbersome apparatus,
musicians penciled notations on score sheets, a
quar tet of dancers in ballet costume burlesqued a
number from the
Firebird
.
Lily Inez sat down a yard from the glass partition,
dialed. ﬁMister Nor man Rettjer, please– .Tell him
M iss Smolyank a would like to speak to him.ﬂ She
smiled impishly at D on. ﬁ With a name like that you
wonder I want to change it?... Oh, God!ﬂThe smile
vanished. ﬁLook!ﬂ She huddled down in her seat,
pointing.

-
ing out P-A-I-N-T-I-N- GT-H-E T- O -W-N, he saw Elton
Hadley in agitated conversation with a handsome
woman in a heather t weedŠa woman in her early
thir ties with a haught y manner, cold, patr ician fea
-
tures, and dark glasses hiding her eyes.
ﬁHelen Rettjer! Nor man™s wife.ﬂ Lily Inez held her
hand over the mouthpiece. ﬁI™ve never seen her at
the studio before. She mustn™t see me!ﬂ
121
D on stepped between her and the glass partition.
ﬁG o ahead on your call.ﬂ He thought the imperious
lady was telling o˜ Hadley in spades; the manager™s
huge head was bobbing, his childlike hands were
held out in anxious appeal.
ﬁNor man?ﬂThe timbre of Lily Inez ™ voice became
noticeably more husk y.ﬁThat man from Ambletts is
here in the studio with me – yes, yes, I knowŠbut
it ™s absolutely important I tell you now, r ight this
minute – ﬁ
D on observed Hadley beckoning to the assistant
direc tor in the houndstooth jacket.The latter hurr ied
over, listened to the voluble lady in the dark glasses;
then, he, too, began to shrug and shake his head in
obvious denial.
ﬁM ister Cadee,ﬂ Lily Inez said,ﬁ tells me your pres
-
ent is to delivered some time tonight – Do you k now
about that? –Yes? –Then he has to see you imme
-
diately before you complete the arrangements.ﬂ
On the ˛oor below, M issus Rettjer held up a
gloved hand, spoke br ie˛y and bitterly, swung on
her heel, and stalked away disdainfully.
ﬁI realize you have other matters which are
impor tant, Nor man, but this is a matter of life and
death, I mean it– .YesŠand by the wayŠHelen
is here in the studio, now. Do you k now what she
wants?ﬂ
Hadley exchanged earnest words with the assis
-
tant directer before he loped after Missus R ettjer,
caught up with her, began an expostulation which
stopped the lady in her tracks.
ﬁNo, I haven™t spoken to her – I don™t intend
to, no.What? – All r ight, I™ll tell him. – Oh, I™m so
122
utter ly wretched I™m going straight back to the apar t
-
ment –Yes, call me there.ﬂ She hung up.ﬁIs she still
here?ﬂ
D on moved aside.ﬁ The coast is clear.Your man
-
ager just left with her. D oes her husband know
what ™s on her mind?ﬂ
ﬁNot at all. He™s ˛abbergasted. He thought she
was on her way to Nassau by plane.ﬂ She clapped a
hand to her forehead.ﬁShe must have come here to
make a scene.That ™s all I need, a scene with her. Oh,
G od!ﬂ
ﬁI was right about the coat?ﬂ he asked.
ﬁ Yes, you were.Though he doesn™t believe there™s
anything to be wor r ied about. He says he talked to
one of the men from your store only a little while ago
and there isn™t going to be any trouble at all about
getting the coat back.ﬂ
All a misunderstandingŠwasn™t that what
Grolheim had told Sib last night?
ﬁ When will he see
me?ﬂ
ﬁAs soon as you can get down to his oˆce. Do
you k now where it is? Fort yWall. I ntekcom Holding
Cor poration.ﬂ
ﬁI™ll ˚nd it.ﬂ D on took her arm.ﬁHow much does
M ister Rettjer ™s wife know about you?ﬂ
ﬁNothing – except what she may have heard in
the way of rumors from Las Vegas and so on. She
k nows he doesn™t care for her ; they™ve been all but
legally separated for a year. But she won™t give him
a divorce and he won™t tr y to get one. I suppose she
may suspect there™s another womanŠ or more than
one, for that matter. But I™m sure she has no idea
that Nor m would mar r y me tomor row if he were
123
free.ﬂ
ﬁShe has ideas about something; she was giving
your manager a bad ˚ve minutes there.ﬂ
Lily Inez sighed.ﬁThis is the day I™ve been dread
-
ing. Helen wouldn™t have come here unless she™d
meant to have a showdown.ﬂ She followed him up
the tier of steps.ﬁIt makes me think she must have
sent me those horr id r hymes. Maybe she arranged
to have the coat stolenŠthough how she could have
found out about that – ﬂHer voice trailed away.
D on thought she was ˚ghting to keep back a
˛ood of tears.ﬁ You™re not going to rehearse this
af ter noon?ﬂ
ﬁNo.ﬂ
ﬁI may drop around to the apartment later then.ﬂ
He went down the shor t ˛ight, out to the studio
˛oor. Neither Hadley nor Helen Rettjer was in sight,
nor did he see either of them in the lobby ofTelecast
Towers as be left the building.
The oˆces of Intekcom were as quiet and sub
-
dued as the studio had been noisy and confused.
The receptionist was an elderly man who looked like
a professor.
ﬁM ister Rettjer is expecting you, Mister Cadee.
This way, if you please.ﬂ
The ˚nancier™s oˆce was homey rather than
impressive. No deskŠmerely a large table spread
with charts. Easy chairs, and logs glowing in a cheer
-
ful br ick ˚replace. A small bar, a giant television set
– and the man himself, a small-boned man with a
rock-hard face, smoking a pipe and scrutinizing his
visitor through r imless spectacles before o˜er ing to
shake hands.
124
ﬁI can understand your store™s position in this
matter, Mister Cadee.ﬂ
ﬁ Then we won™t waste time on that.ﬂ D on refused
a cigar. ﬁI™m here because of my personal interest
in t wo of our men. Not because of the crown sable
c o a t .ﬂ
R ettjer rubbed the bowl of the briar against the
side of his nose.ﬁI™m glad to be able to set your mind
at ease on that score. I had a ver y pleasant conver
-
sation with your M ister Grolheim; he anticipates no
fur ther diˆculties in the transac tion.ﬂ
ﬁ What about the other man? Jim Preston?ﬂ
ﬁ Your fur buyer didn™t mention him, M ister
Cadee.ﬂ
ﬁ Then you don™t k now whether he™s still alive?ﬂ
The ˚nancier smiled tolerantly.ﬁNothing Mister
Grolheim said indicated any unpleasantness, so I
assume both your men are quite all r ight and will be
back on the job tomor row.ﬂ
ﬁI don™t assume that,ﬂ D on said bluntly.ﬁAnd as
for unpleasantness, there™s been plenty. I was put
through a rock crusher by one of the hijackers last
night.ﬂ
R ettjer showed no emotion. ﬁI k new nothing of
that ﬂ
ﬁEvidently there are other things you don™t k now.
I have damn good reason to believe Jim Preston was
slugged unconscious, probably killed, outside Miss
I nez ™ apar tment last night when the sables were
stolen.ﬂ
ﬁShe told me you were afraid he had been hurt.ﬂ
ﬁI™m afraid he™s dead. As dead as the member of
the gang the police found in Grolheim™s house this
125
mor ning.ﬂ
R ettjer knocked the ashes out of his pipe against
the brick of the ˚replace.ﬁI didn™t know about that.
And it ™s quite clear M ister Grolheim didn™t know it,
either.ﬂ
D on said: ﬁ What k ind of a blackmail proposition
did he put up to you?ﬂ
ﬁAh – that ™s a rather rough ter m to use, isn™t it?ﬂ
ﬁ What the hell else can you call it?ﬂ D on retor ted.
ﬁ You™re going to have to pay for the sables a second
time, else they wouldn™t release the coat ... or our
men. Only reason you™d pay would be to avoid
publicity.Well, let me tell you, there™s bound to be
a mess of publicity anyhow, now there™s been a
murder. I can™t help that; what I may be able to do is
help get our men out of the hands of some murder
-
ous bastards. And the ˚rst thing I need to know is
exac tly what k ind of a deal you made with them.ﬂ
ﬁEven,ﬂ R ettjer said softly,ﬁif my telling you
should cause your fr iends to su˜er for it? Because
that ™s part of the deal, M ister Cadee.That I tell no
one of the ter ms. O ther wise, your employees may
regret it.ﬂ
ﬁ You™ll tell me.ﬂ D on was brusque.ﬁYou™ll tell me
here and now. B ecause I know just how much cause
Jim Preston and Myron Grolheim have had to regret
it already.ﬂ
ﬁSupposeﬂŠR ettjer eyed him speculativelyŠﬂI
think it wiser to refuse your request?ﬂ
ﬁI might,ﬂ D on said,ﬁbe able to make you change
your mind.ﬂ

**IN SMALL BILLS**

**THE FINANCIER R OSE, SAUNTERED TOTHE**

˚replace. ﬁA lot of people have tr ied to make me
change my mind, M ister Cadee.ﬂ He picked up a
brass poker from the ˚re set on the brick hear th. ﬁI
suppose you would go to the police?ﬂ
ﬁ To the newspapers,ﬂ Don said.ﬁNo city desk
could pass up a stor y about a prominent indus
-
tr ialist, a celebrated television star, a crown sable
coatŠand an extor tion attempt that involved
murder. B y the way, if you pay o˜ the blackmailers,
you might wind up charged as an accessor y.ﬂ
R ettjer bent to poke at a smolder ing log; his face
was momentarily hidden. ﬁI t seems to me your
M ister Grolheim is the accessor y, if not the principal.
He was one of the very few who k new about the
sables, knew when and where they were to be deliv
-
ered. He prac tically admitted that he was to share in
the ransom if it was paid. Now you tell me one of his
127
par tners in crime was found beaten to death in his
house.Yet you claim your interest is in getting him
out of the hands of the gang.ﬂ
ﬁI don™t believe Grolheim is a thief or an ex tor tion
-
ist, much less a murderer.ﬂ
R ettjer turned around.ﬁHow did you k now the
sables were to be retur ned?ﬂ
ﬁGrolheim called me up, too.ﬂ
ﬁ What did he say?ﬂ
ﬁ That arrangements had been made to have the
coat delivered to M iss Inez sometime this evening.ﬂ
ﬁ You k nowﬂŠR ettjer swung the poker idlyŠﬂthe
newspapers might make something out of the facts
that a couple of Ambletts employees left the store
with the sables and one of them later called you up,
noti˚ed you that a proposition had been made to
me about the retur n of the merchandise. Doesn™t put
your store in a ver y favorable light ﬂ
ﬁD epends how it ™s put,ﬂ D on said. ﬁ There are
witnesses who can prove that one of our men was
slugged while attempting to protec t the store™s
propert y. I can testify that I was given a fair ly brutal
wor kover while trying to trace the gar ment. And
from the way Grolheim talked to me on the phone,
I™d say he was aware that his own life is in danger.ﬂ
ﬁ That wasn™t my impression.ﬂ
ﬁ You don™t know the man.ﬂ
ﬁHe seemed absolutely unconcer ned about any
-
thing except the payment demanded, absolutely
cold-blooded.ﬂ
ﬁ That ™s the point ﬂ Don said.ﬁGrolheim is anything
but coldblooded. He™s normally tense and jumpy.
They have him bu˜aloed in some way – with a gun
128
at his back. Or a threat of tor ture.ﬂ
ﬁUnder the circumstances you think it would be
foolish to believe he would keep his word?ﬂ
ﬁAbout the coat?They ™ll send it back.What else
can they do with it? I t™s not negotiable like your secu
-
r ities. But I™m not wor r ied about the sables. I want
Jim Preston and Myron Grolheim back ... if it isn™t too
l a t e .ﬂ
ﬁ Your buyer was explicit on that score; he said
there™d be no further diˆculties of any k ind, once
the transaction was completed.ﬂ
ﬁHe may have believed that. He might not know
about the murder.They may have kept him in the
dar k about Jim Preston. But there™ll be plent y of
diˆculties for the other members of the gangŠand
they k now it, whether Grolheim does or notﬂ
ﬁ Then you suggest I go through with the plan?ﬂ
ﬁHow can I tell until I know what you agreed to
do?ﬂ
R ettjer replaced the poker, straightened up.ﬁI™m
to have ˚ft y thousand in small bills packed in a brief
case. At six o™clock someone will call me at the Buck
-
inghurst apartment to tell me what to do with the
money. At seven another call will notify me where to
pick up the coat.ﬂ He went to the bar. ﬁS ounds like a
Grade -B movie, doesn™t it?ﬂ
ﬁDid Grolheim say you were to deliver the brief
case yourself?ﬂ
ﬁNo. Only that I should follow instruc tions to
the letter and, of course, refrain from notifying the
author ities. Dr ink?ﬂ
ﬁI can use one.ﬂ
ﬁS cotch?ﬂ
129
ﬁAnd water.Thanks. How would it be if you gave
me the brief case, let me deliver it?ﬂ
R ettjer clattered ice cubes into glasses. ﬁI™m
beginning to change my mind about you, Mister
Cadee. I will admit that my preconception about a
depar tment store detec tive wasn™t too ˛atter ing.
Evidently I was wrong in your case.You have a hell of
a ner ve to ask me to hand over ˚f t y thousand dollars
to a man I™ve never seen before in my life. But this
seems to be a circumstance where a hell of a nerve is
needed. How will you operate?ﬂ
D on took the highball.ﬁHave to play it by ear. Ill
be at the Buckinghurst by six and take it from there.ﬂ
ﬁEven though it may jeopardize your own men?ﬂ
ﬁ They ™re already jeopardized ... up to here. I may
be able to convince the contac t man for the gang
that it will be a break for all concerned if they ™ll turn
Preston and Grolheim loose.Whatever happens, it
won™t a˜ec t your coat deal.ﬂ
ﬁM ay a˜ect you.ﬂ
ﬁCalculated risk .You k now about that sort of
thing.You™re taking a few yourself.ﬂ D on thought the
˚nancier was relieved at the idea of having someone
else handle the ransom matter.ﬁM iss I nez suspects
your wife of sending those jingles, has an idea Missus
R ettjer may have connived at having the sables
stolen.ﬂ
ﬁA natural enough conjec ture but without the
slightest foundation.ﬂ R ettjer smiled; the smile trans
-
for med his hard features, mak ing him suddenly very
lik able.ﬁ Tell you something, M ister Cadee. A woman
has to care a lot about a man to be jealous of him.
M y wife doesn™t care that much about me; she™s not
130
jealous, not even interested.ﬂ
ﬁ Then why did she go to the studio this morning?ﬂ
ﬁShe thought I might be there. She had been
tr ying to reach me here at the oˆce. I was out. Far
as I k new she was ˛ying to the Bahamas ... but she™s
always changing her mind at the last minute.ﬂ He
waved the pipe stem. ﬁI t had nothing to do with the
coat, you may be sure. I have told M iss Inez that she
might look closer to her own establishment for the
author of those creepy couplets.ﬂ
ﬁAs close as – ?
ﬁHer maid. Frances resents me; I once suggested
she should be discharged. She™s always asking for
increases; she gets more right now than either of
my secretar ies. Fancies she ought to be paid o˜ for
keeping quiet about my visits to the apartment,
I suppose. Neither Miss I nez nor I believe in start
-
ing that; once you begin to hand out hush money,
there™s no end to it. Besides, there™s nothing in
par ticular for us to hide. I™m fond of Lily; she likes
me.We don™t broadcast it but we are cer tainly not
ashamed of it.ﬂ
D on raised his eyebrows.ﬁNot ˚ft y thousand dol
-
lars™ worth?ﬂ
ﬁOh no. Not at all.The ransom for the coat is
another matter. I want her to have those sables; I
have gone to considerable trouble and expense to
see she does have them. Putting up the additional
money may seem like a high premium in order to
protec t my original investmentŠper haps if I had
thought I could get a duplicate I might have tur ned
down M ister Grolheim™s o˜er. But there™s no such
thing as a duplicate. It might be two or three years
131
before I could have another one made up; it takes
that long to have the skins matched. By that time I
might be dead. Or she might. I want her to have it
now. S o ... I will have that br ief case ready for you at
six tonight.ﬂ
ﬁ You™re not telling M iss Inez the details of the
ar rangement?ﬂ
ﬁ You are the only one who knows.ﬂ
ﬁB etter that way.ﬂ D on put his glass on the bar.
ﬁ You might have another call from M ister Grolheim,
before this evening.ﬂ
ﬁ What makes you think so?ﬂ
ﬁAf ter noon papers will carr y the story of that dead
man. I t may rattle the rest of the gang.They might
even want to move up the time for the delivery of the
money.ﬂ
ﬁI™ll let you k now if that happens.ﬂ
ﬁAt the store. Leave a message with my secretary.ﬂ

## CHAPTER 20

MAX ﬁTHE BURNERﬂ
**TILLSON**

**PASSING THE NEWSSTAND IN THE LOBBY ON HIS WAY**

out, D on received a mild jolt; Max ™s pale eyes and
wol˚sh fangs sneered up at him from a photograph
occupying the front page of a pinkish tabloid.The
scarehead said:
**HUNT THRILL KILLER**

**IN TEENAGER™S DEATH**

D on bought a copy, read the ﬁStor y on PageTwoﬂ
r iding uptown in a cab. Evidently Dimmock and
Q uinton had made quick identi˚cation from the
youth™s ˚ngerpr ints:
Max ﬁThe Burnerﬂ Tillson, 16, recently
released from Bronx Boys Correctional
Institution, was found dead this morn
-
ing in the West End Avenue residence
133
of a wealthy fur man, Myron Grolheim.
Police investigating a broken areaway
door discovered the body, brutally
mutilated. Except for the murdered
teenager, there was no one in the
three-story house. An intensive search
is underway for Grolheim, who was known
to be in the city yesterday. Tillson
had been released from the reformatory

of a six months™ term for the theft
of a tobacco distributor™s truck.
The rest was a rewr ite man™s sensationalism,
a suggestion Šin the form of a quer yŠasking
whether the boy might have been a victim of some
homicidal sadist, without mentioning Grolheim
speci˚cally.The background for this seemed to be
thatTillson had once belonged to a teenage gang,
the Mott Avenue M alays, so known because they
liked to boast of running amuck among their juvenile
enemies.
You hit it on the nose. The kid had been a jumper.
When the cops ˚nd out about the stolen sables,
they™ll ˚gure that Max had inside information from My
Grolheim and was put out of the way to keep the fac t
quiet.That ™ll be your fault, boy : you had a chance to
tell Dimmock about Max and his side-kick trailing My
for days – and you said nothing.The Homicide boys
will have good reason to feel you™ve been covering up
an inside job, too.
G etting out of the cab in front of the Ber kowsk y
building, he felt suddenly ver y weary.
The strain of
134
not k nowing whether you™re playing it the right way,
boy. But you gave your word to Ruth Preston – and
while there™s a chance Jim may get out of this all r ight;
you wouldn™t want to play it any other way.
The oˆces of Wolheim B er kowsky & S ons
were on the ground ˛oor, facing Seventh Avenue.
Gloomy, high-ceilinged, paneled in dark walnut,
with old-fashioned lighting ˚xtures and somber steel
engravings such as used to be popular around the
tur n of the centur y. But there was nothing out of
date about Mor r is B erkowsk y.The junior vice -pres
-
ident was Brooks Brothers and Iv y League and Par k
Avenue: tall and rangy and brisk ly businesslike.
He took Don into an oˆce with scores of framed
and signed photographs on the walls, a social gal
-
ler y, ladies of the haut monde.
ﬁM iss Gates didn™t tell me just what you have in
mind, Mister Cadee, but I gathered it had to do with
a cer tain garment we made for your store.ﬂ
ﬁ That ™s cor rec t.The crown sable coat was
hijacked last night before My Grolheim could deliver
it to the customer.ﬂ
B er kowsk y didn™t seem to be surpr ised. ﬁ You were
covered? By insurance in transit?ﬂ
ﬁI™m not certain. But Ambletts isn™t tr ying to evade
responsibility for payment.We™re told the garment
will be retur ned undamaged; anyhow the purchaser
isn™t going to renege on the deal. But a couple of our
men were taken along with the coat M ister Grolheim
and one of my best Protec tion men, Jim Preston.
Ambletts is more concer ned about the men than the
merchandise, Mister B erkowsk y.ﬂ
ﬁ You say Myron is in the hands of these
135
hijackers?ﬂ B er kowsk y was puzzled.ﬁI spoke to him
only an hour ago.ﬂ
ﬁI talked to him this morning, too,ﬂ D on said.ﬁHe
called up to say the coat would be returned and that
he would also be free in a day or so. But I think he
was ac ting under duress.ﬂ
ﬁI t didn™t seem so to me.The reason I wasn™t too
sur pr ised to hear about the theft was that M yron
wanted to know if we could suggest another cus
-
tomer who might be interested in buying the coat if
the sale fell through.ﬂ Ber kowsk y frowned. ﬁI t struck
me as a queer question, though of course we do run
up against instances where the purchaser is unable
to take some expensive garment and we do have to
look around for another customer. But M yron would
be more likely to k now of a possible taker for this
rather – extraordinar y gar ment– than I would. So
it threw me a bit.ﬂ
ﬁ What did you tell him?ﬂ
ﬁ WhyŠthat we would make some discreet inqui
-
r ies, let him know. M y ˚rst supposition was that the
gentleman who ordered the coat had had some
disagreement with the lady for whom it had been
designed.ﬂ
ﬁNothing like that. He still wants to give her the
coat even though he™s going to have to pay a ransom
in addition to your pr ice.ﬂ
ﬁNo k idding!ﬂThe frown deepened.ﬁCer tainly
be the most expensive item of apparel the wor ld
has ever seen, then. But I™m more ba˙ed than ever,
M ister Cadee.You see, Myron gave no indication
that his personal safet y was involved. He did sound
rather vague, but I laid that to his distress at having
136
such a large transac tion screwed up. As near as I can
recall, the closest he came to hinting there might be
something wrong was to say his plans hadn™t wor ked
out quite as he had expected.You™re sure there is no
mistake about his having been abducted along with
the coat?ﬂ
ﬁ You mean do I believe he might have been in on
the steal?ﬂ D on asked.ﬁI don™t I think he™s in great
danger. As soon as the ransom has been paid over,
there™s a good chance he™ll go the way this kid went.ﬂ
He held out the paper.
B er kowsk y turned to PageTwo, scowling. Af ter a
moment he looked up.ﬁ This seems to say Myron was
the murderer.ﬂ
ﬁHe wasn™t.You k now him, you know he wouldn™t
have the heart to k ill anyone.ﬂ
ﬁI would have said that™s r ight StillŠﬂ
ﬁ The paper™s whooping up a sensation. I t didn™t
have the facts because the police didn™t have them.
I had been war ned by My not to give them any
dope, otherwise he and Jim Preston might not be
allowed to go free,ﬂ D on said.ﬁNow I™m damn sure
that a crook who would k ill one of his own partners
in cr ime wouldn™t trunk twice about ˚nishing o˜
a couple of witnesses to his misdeeds.These calls
from MyŠhe talked to our customer as well as to you
and me Šadd up to just one thing.They ™re ˚xing to
make him the patsy – for the hijack and the murder
of this Max as well.ﬂ
B er kowsk y nodded.ﬁI f I had to testify in cour t
about that phone call, it would certainly make him
seem like one of the gang, that ™s true.ﬂ
ﬁI t comes down to this,ﬂ Don said.ﬁI have to
137
locate this bunch of highbinders before they get the
ransom.ﬂ
ﬁI f there™s any way our ˚rm can help – ﬂ
ﬁNot unless some of your people can recognize
the man who wor ked with this MaxTillson when
Preston was slugged outside Miss I nez ™ apartment.ﬂ
D on described the fellow as Salvatore hadŠthe
broken nose, the bulgy pug-dog eyes, the slimy
smile, the sapphire ring. He added, ﬁAnd Grolheim
said he might have been an Italian.ﬂ
ﬁHe never wor ked for us,ﬂ Ber kowsk y said. ﬁI™ll
go further ; I doubt if he ever wor ked in a fur factor y.
Ver y few I talians in this business, very few. O f course
he may have been a truck driverŠbut that star sap
-
phire doesn™t make it seem likely.ﬂ
ﬁNo,ﬂ Don agreed.ﬁOne more thing. How long
have you known M y?ﬂ
ﬁ Ten or twelve years,ﬂ B er kowsk y said. ﬁHe™s
always had a ˚rst- class reputation in the trade, not
especially in a sociable sense, but as an individual of
integr ity. I would be unhappy to revise my opinion of
him.ﬂ
ﬁ That ™s all I wanted to know.ﬂ D on said he™d keep
Wolheim Ber kowsk y & S ons in touch with develop
-
ments, then said good-by.
As he came out of the building, Baisha Gates
rushed across the sidewalk, clutched his arm.ﬁI
didn™t want to barge in while you were busy with
M or r ie, but I simply had to catch you before you
went back to the store, Mister Cadee.ﬂ
ﬁ Why?ﬂ he asked,ﬁDid you latch onto something
at S ar i Soeurs?ﬂ
ﬁOh, I have the list of their mink minxesﬂŠshe
138
giggled foolishlyŠﬂbut I can™t tell whether it™ll be
any help to you or not.ﬂ She took a sheet of crested
notepaper out of her coat pocket.ﬁHere – and don™t
blame me for all the Miss Joneses and MissWhites
and M iss Johnsons they gave me. I k now they aren™t
the ladies™ real names and they know it, too, but
what are they to do if some gentleman says a blue
pastel is for plain Miss Smith when her name is prob
-
ably Hortense Hassenpfe˜er!ﬂ
ﬁ You didn™t rush over here just to give me this
list?ﬂ
ﬁOh no.ﬂ She whipped o˜ her horn-r ims, peered
up at him anxiously.ﬁI waylaid you because Miss
K ahn said you mustn™t come back to the oˆce.ﬂ
ﬁ That so?ﬂ
ﬁNot until you™ve talked to her, any way.There are
t wo policemen waiting with a war rant for you.ﬂ

## CHAPTER 21

**THE SLASHER**

DONTOOK BAISHA™S ARM.ﬁLE T ™S HOP ACR OSSTO
that drugstore. Unless you™re afraid of being seen
with a desperate cr iminal.™™
ﬁI™m not a bit afraid.ﬂ She snuggled against him
crossing the streetﬁI always said you™d be one of
the ten most wanted men, Mister Cadee. But I didn™t
mean it in the police sense. I f there™s anything I can
do to help you – ﬂ
ﬁ There is. Call M iss Kahn from that booth, give her
the number of the phone, have her ring back soon as
she can get away from my oˆce.ﬂ He ran inter ference
past the pushing lunch-hour crowd t wo and three
deep at the busy fountain.
I n the booth a stout man spoke earnestly to
the phone, beating the air with a hairy hand for
emphasis.
Baisha said: ﬁ What did you do that put the police
af ter you?ﬂ
ﬁI went up to M y Grolheim™s house to see what
might have happened to him. They want to know
140
about it; I don™t want to tell‚em until My gets back.ﬂ
He scanned the list from Sar i S oeurs. Many of the
names he recognized as being on Ambletts™ No -Lim
-
it-to - Credit list. A few were familiar from the ˚nancial
pages of the daily press.There was a scatter ing of
anonymities, the noms de-joie for mistresses of men
in the uppermost tax brackets. And ... two thirds
down the t yped column, the name of M issus Norman
R ettjer.
The stout man shouted an imprecation, slammed
the receiver at the hook, backed out of the booth
still mutter ing to himself.
D on said: ﬁD on™t tell Beck y you™re with me,
Baisha. Just have her buzz you back .ﬂ
She huddled over the phone dial.
D on wondered what might be the signi˚cance
of M issus Rettjer ™s ownership of a Sar i S oeurs mink .
Had she lent it to a friend? Given it to a less a˙uent
relative? Sold it– within a year of purchasing it?
None of them seemed possibilities. Anyhow, since
the Homicide hounds had made such a swiftly eˆ
-
cient identi˚cation of Max, it was more than likely
they already k new about the brunette in the tur
-
quoise gown, knew who she was and what had been
her connection with the dead ﬁBur ner.ﬂ
Baisha said: ﬁ That ™s it, that ™s ˚ne,ﬂ started to edge
out of the booth.
D on put his hand between her shoulder blades.
ﬁStay there. Stick with it. Others waiting to use the
booth. Have to keep ‚em waiting.ﬂ
She nodded.ﬁI™ll pretend to be talking ... but I™ll
hold the hook down so nobody™ll notice.ﬂ
ﬁ That ™s the idea.ﬂThe pneumatic hammers began
141
to pound at his ears again. The store was hot, the air
was close. Smells of frying hamburger and chocolate
malteds mingled with the odors of sweaty clothing
and too strong per fumes. An impatient line of the
thwar ted telephone -minded pressed against him
ir r itably.
I t seemed much longer than the four minute his
wr ist watch indicated before the phone bell rang
shar ply and Baisha Gates let the hook ˛y up.
ﬁAll alone now, M iss K ahn? – Yes, yes – he™s r ight
here .. . I™ll put him on.ﬂ
D on squeezed past her. ﬁHello, B ecky. Gendar mes
still in the oˆng?ﬂ
ﬁ Yes indeed.ﬂ H is secretary seemed harassed.
ﬁ That S ergeant Q uinton has been camped beside my
desk for the last hour. And Lieutenant Dimmock was
at your desk for a whilesŠ waiting for you to call in,
I supposeŠbut he left about ten minutes ago to see
M ister Stolz. I™ve been on pins and needles for fear
you might walk in so I had Alice posted out in the
hall to war n you.ﬂ
ﬁ That ™s using your head. About Miss Gates, too.
Did they tell you what the war rant charges?ﬂ
ﬁDimmock wouldn™t utter a peep. But the ser
-
geant loosened up after the lieutenant lef t. It seems
someone saw you leaving Mister Grolheim™s house
this mor ning, descr ibed your bruised face.ﬂ
ﬁDid he say who saw me?ﬂ
ﬁNo. ButﬂŠB eck y hesitatedŠﬁ he did mention
there was a gir l with you. And you were carr ying a
suitcase.ﬂ
ﬁS ounds sort of incr iminating, doesn™t it?ﬂ
ﬁNow, Mister Cadee ... I didn™t suggest any such
142
thing!ﬂ
ﬁJust jesting, B eck y. Did you tell Quinton when
you expect me back?ﬂ
ﬁAf ter lunch sometime. I had to say something....ﬂ
ﬁO f course. You did exac tly right.ﬂ
ﬁ Well, I don™t k now. I really didn™t k now what to
tell the captain.ﬂ
ﬁCaptain? What captain?ﬂ
ﬁEadie. At the precinct.You k now him.ﬂ
ﬁSure. But I didn™t k now he was in the act.ﬂ
ﬁI t wasn™t about having you ar rested. He wanted
to speak to you about that gir l we sent to the hospi
-
tal, that slasher.ﬂ
ﬁ What about her?ﬂ
ﬁCaptain Eadie said that under the circumstances
he™d just have the charges against her ˚led unless
he heard from you that Ambletts is going to insist on
prosecution.ﬂ
D on stared at the penciled doodlings and scrib
-
bled phone numbers on the wall of the booth.
What
the hell had Eadie been blithering about?
ﬁDid he
mention what circumstances he had reference to,
B eck y?ﬂ
ﬁNo, he didn™t. All he said was that doc tors were
like lawyers Šif you could a˜ord to pay for the right
ones you could prove anything you wanted to. He
said he thought you™d understand. But I didn™t.ﬂ
ﬁ We™re in the same boat. It ™s Greek to me. But I™ll
see if I can wor k out a translation. Did Quinton k now
it was the precinc t calling me?ﬂ
ﬁOh no. I took the message in shorthand. The
sergeant was look ing over my shoulder but I guess it
was Greek to him.ﬂ
143
ﬁNo doubt.ﬂ He realized that Eadie™s crack about
doc tors must mean that the gir l had been cer ti˚ed
sane at the PsychWard.
But then why had she been
released . .. with a thousand dollars or so of mutilated
merchandise still to be paid for?Well, hell, you™ve
more important ˚sh to fry. Her case will have to wait.

ﬁAnything else on the ˚re, Beck y?ﬂ
ﬁM ister Stolz has been calling about those dam
-
aged alligator bags.ﬂ
ﬁHas he, now?ﬂ
With a hundred-thousand-dollar
coat numbered among the missing, Stolz has to worry
about a slasher? What goes?
ﬁJust let him stew ; it™s
his nor mal condition.ﬂ
ﬁR ight. And what ™ll I say to the sergeant if he asks
whether I™ve heard from you?ﬂ
ﬁLie like a lady. Sib™ll get in touch with you after
lunch.ﬂ As he left the booth, he had to sidestep an
elbowing woman who muttered something about
ﬁpeople who spend their lunch hour on the phone.ﬂ
Baisha grasped his ar m as they struggled to
the street ﬁ Why do they want to ar rest you, Mister
Cadee?ﬂ
ﬁ They think I know a lot more about My Grolheim
than I really do. And by the way, they ™re looking for
you, too.ﬂ
ﬁEeee!ﬂ She squeaked in excitementﬁFor me?ﬂ
ﬁ To ˚nd out what you know about his
disappearance.ﬂ
ﬁButŠI don™t know anything about it.ﬂ
ﬁ You do, though. And you have to be careful not
to tell them – about the crown sable coatﬂ
ﬁI f you say I shouldn™t, I won™t breathe a syllable
about it.ﬂ She quivered with the intensit y of her
144
pledge.
ﬁI t may be bad for My if you let anything slip.ﬂ
ﬁI won™t, I won™t!Wild horses couldn™tŠﬂ
ﬁAnd one thing more. Forget to mention you met
me outside the store.ﬂ
ﬁ You k now you can trust me, Mister Cadee.ﬂ
ﬁSure of it, Baisha.Thanks for your help and your
discretion.ﬂ He gave her a smile, a brother ly pat,
hailed a cruising cab, slid in.
The dr iver looked over his shoulder inquiringly.
ﬁB ellevue Hospital,ﬂ D on said.ﬁFront entrance.ﬂ
You may be shooting o˜ at a tangent, checking on
Captain Eadie™s cr yptic message. On the other hand,
Bob Stolz is no dope; he knows you™re not going to get
sidetracked on anything that doesn™t a˜ec t the safety
of Jim Preston and M y Grolheim. So there must be
some connection– .
He found the Psychiatr icWard, located the super
-
visor, stated his er rand.
But the elderly-lady in the lace cap shook her
head.ﬁ We have no record of any such admission.
You say you don™t k now the patient ™s name?ﬂ
ﬁNo. But the police brought her here a couple
of hours ago. From Ambletts Fifth Avenue.ﬂ He
descr ibed her as carefully as he could. ﬁA good-look
-
ing teenager, nicely groomed, well dressed. She
refused to give us any name or address.ﬂ
The supervisor raised one eyebrow.ﬁPossibly she
was taken to some other hospital.We have no such
detention patient held for obser vation.ﬂ She went to
the desk, came back with a typed list mounted on
a clip board, held it out for his inspection.ﬁS ee for
yourself.ﬂ

**PULLERS**

DON GLANCED AT THE CLIP BOARD. ﬁNAMES ARE NO
help. I told youŠI don™t k now this gir l ™s name. But I
k now she was brought here. I f she™s not here now, I
want to know why you let her go.ﬂ
ﬁS or r y.ﬂThe supervisor was aloof, apparently
disinterested.ﬁUnless you have the patient ™s name,
we could under no consideration give out any
infor mation.ﬂ
He reached for his wallet, thinking that identi˚ca
-
tion might to some ex tent o˜set a poor impression
created by his bunged-up face, his fatigue.ﬁHere™s
my cardŠﬂ he said, before he realized that he had no
wallet, merely a few dollars he had borrowed from
Sibyl – and no Ambletts cards whatever.
She waited a moment before turning away dis
-
dainfully.ﬁ You will excuse meŠﬂ
ﬁNot yet.ﬂ He tapped her on the shoulder.ﬁ Which
doc tor is in charge of this ward?ﬂ
146
ﬁO ur chief psychiatr ist is not here at this time of
day.ﬂ She was sti˙y resentful at his touching her.
ﬁ These are not visiting hours, either. I must ask you
to leave now.ﬂ
ﬁI™m not leaving.ﬂ D on was chagr ined and irr i
-
tated.ﬁNot until I ˚nd out why you™re stalling about
this k id.What ™s the name of the doctor who™s in
charge here r ight now?ﬂ
ﬁD oc tor Hamlin.ﬂ She retreated behind her desk.
ﬁBut he can give you no more infor mation than I.ﬂ
ﬁ We™ll see about that. Where™ll I ˚nd him?ﬂ
ﬁHe is on a tour of the ward.You cannot disturb
him.ﬂ
ﬁNo? He™ll have the hell disturbed out of him if
you keep on giving me the run-around.ﬂ He went to
the desk angr ily,ﬁ You can™t brush me o˜ with double
talk . I deal with too much of that in Protec tion wor k .
G et hold of this Hamlin before I br ing in a cour t order
to have you produce this prisoner.ﬂ
ﬁ We can™t produce a patient who hasn™t been
admitted.ﬂ
ﬁA police matron and a plain-clothes man brought
her in.Their Captain at the precinc t advised me
that somebody had pulled a fast one to keep her
under cover. What are you people trying to hide? A
suicide?ﬂ
ﬁR eally!ﬂ Suddenly she was on the defensive.
ﬁR eallyŠI am unable to furnish the information you
wish.ﬂ
ﬁOk ay.Then call police headquarters on that
phone. Let me talk toŠﬂ He reached for the phone.
ﬁNo! –Wait! – Don™t!ﬂ Her eyes betrayed panic.
ﬁStep down the hall to the Visitors™ R oom. I will ask
147
D oc tor Hamlin to con˚r m what I have told you.ﬂ
ﬁ That ™s more like it.ﬂ He stalked down the cor r i
-
dor, with wear iness sweeping over him like heav y
sur f.The hospital smell was depressing, the sight of
a nurse padding into a room car r ying a canvas jacket
with dangling tapes was ominous.
M aybe this is where My Grolheim ought to be. No
man in his right mind would have called up Ruth Pres
-
ton, Norman R ettjer, Mor r is B er kowsk y and calmly
discussed a bloody crime as ﬁsome sor t of mistake.ﬂ
I t wasn™t rational to refer to the hijacking, the attack
on Press, the murder of M ax as a ﬁmisunderstandingﬂ
which would be cor rec ted to ever yone™s satisfaction
if those concer ned simply sat tight and kept quiet.
Grolheim must be o˜ his rocker. Or maybe you are,
boy! M aybe that clout on the cranium was too much
for you!
But he knew better. He was physically exhausted
from the beating, mentally wear y from lack of sleep,
that was all.
There was no one in the Visitors™ R oom. He
brooded at the bar red windows, the gray sluggish
-
ness of the East River seen far below through the
dust- gray windows.
I t might have been better, he thought, if he had
called B ob Stolz from the drugstore, to learn why
B ob considered the relatively slight damage wrought
by the slasher as in any way impor tant compared to
the loss of a hundred-thousand-dollar coat, to the
vastly greater problem of what had happened to
Press, to Grolheim. But then, he realized, Stolz would
have had Lieutenant Dimmock there at his elbow
and couldn™t have spoken freely.
148
A tall, spare man with the stooped shoulders of
a professor and a deeply lined face came down the
hall at an unhurr ied gait. He smiled with his eyes.ﬁI
am D oc tor Hamlin.ﬂ He held out his hand.
ﬁD on Cadee, Chief of Store Protec tion at
Ambletts, Doc tor.ﬂ
ﬁ You™ve been having a little diˆculty with M iss
Stevens?ﬂ
ﬁ Your supervising nurse? She was giving me the
brush-o˜ ; I can™t waste time horsing around with her.
We picked up a teenage gir l af ter she™d destroyed a
lot of valuable merchandise out of sheer malicious
-
ness. Ordinarily we don™t prosecute such cases, gives
other delinquents ideas. Normal procedure is to
obtain a confession, get in touch with the parents,
ar range for payment of the damaged articles. But
this k id refused to give us her name. She was ar ro
-
gant and decidedly unrepentant. She as much as
said that what she wanted was to be arrested and
paraded in cour t so she could humiliate someone,
get even with her parents possibly.ﬂ
ﬁNot an uncommon motive with modern youth,ﬂ
the doctor said amiably.
ﬁNo.We don™t like to cooperate with such vin
-
dic tiveness, though. But we couldn™t turn her loose
without some infor mation to help us in collecting for
the nylons and lingerie and handbags she™d slashed
with bits of razor blades. So I ar ranged to have her
brought here by a police matron and a detec tive. She
was to be committed for observation, under deten
-
tion, subject to the store™s disposal of her case. Now
I™m told she was never admitted to the PsychWard.
I k now she was. I™m fed up with evasive tactics, with
149
buck passing.What goes?ﬂ
The psychiatr ist sighed. ﬁI don™t blame you for
being resentful, Mister Cadee. But you mustn™t
blame Miss Stevens, either. She had her orders. S o
had I. However, I™m sure our instructions don™t apply
to you; they were simply intended to squelch news
-
paper scandal.ﬂ
ﬁ The police captain at the precinc t suggested
there had been some string pulling.ﬂ
ﬁQ uite cor rec t. R ather prominent str ing pullers.
I must admit I was somewhat surpr ised. O f course
it was immediately apparent, at the brief prelim
-
inar y examination, that the young lady was not a
psychotic. Thirt y years ago she would merely have
been a bad child; nowadays we tr y to understand
such cases before we attempt to punish them. As a
preliminary to a later revaluation we administered a
mild tranquilizer, one of the new meprobamates.ﬂ
ﬁI™d say calming down was what she needed
most.ﬂ
ﬁ Yes.Well, I chatted with her for a few minutes but
she didn™t relax her rebelliousness. She was boast
-
fully con˚dent that she wouldn™t be here long – and
she was right about that.ﬂ D oc tor Hamlin glanced at
his watch. ﬁShe hadn™t been in the ward much more
than an hour when a formidable group showed up
here, inquiring for her.ﬂ
ﬁLaw yers?ﬂ
ﬁOh yes. A brace of attor neys, equipped with
impressive wr its of habeas and what not.There was
also a Doc torVolney, who represented himself as
the gir l™s personal physician of some years™ stand
-
ing. And one of the country ™s foremost psychiatr ists,
150
Leon Shlemm. Are you acquainted with D oc tor
Shlemm?ﬂ
ﬁOnly by reputation.ﬂ
ﬁA splendid reputation – and well deserved.
M atter of fact, I studied under Doctor Shlemm at
Johns Hopkins; my respect for his opinion would
be, naturally, of the highest degree. So when he said
that he was prepared to cer tify that Miss R ettjer was
per fec tlyŠﬂ
D on broke in:ﬁ The ˚nancier™s daughter?ﬂ
ﬁM iss Joyna Rettjer, r ight. I n some way, possibly
by promising a reward to that police matronŠ
though that is merely guesswork on my partŠthe girl
had managed to get word to her parents. The batter y
of learned counsel and medical authority rushed to
her rescue.ﬂ
That explains Bob Stolz™s anxiety to get hold of you.
Probably Cap Eadie™d talked to him when you couldn™t
be reached. Stolz would have agreed to having the
case ˚led, all r ight.That would have made the gir l ™s
release from the hospital legal even though irregular.
S o much it does explain – but it adds to the pile of
puzzles that still need solving.
ﬁ You couldn™t hold her
against all that pressure, D oc tor.ﬂ
ﬁFrank ly, we didn™t want to.Whether it was the
in˛uence of the tranquilizing drug, or whether the
˛ame of the young lady ™s rage had more or less
bur ned itself outŠas often happens, it™s diˆcult to
sustain an emotional outburst of that violent nature
for any great length of time if there is no mental
imbalanceŠ whatever the reason, Miss Rettjer was
as meek as you please at the time of her release.ﬂ
ﬁDid she give any reason for her maliciousness in
151
our store?ﬂ
D oc tor Hamlin pondered a moment.ﬁ You™d better
ask D octor Shlemm as to that. All I can tell you is that
when Doc torVolney asked her why she had behaved
so badly, Miss R ettjer replied:‚I™d have cut her to
r ibbons if I™d had the chance but I knew I couldn™t
so I took it out on them because they started it.™ﬂ He
smiled again. ﬁS or t of incoherent excuse an over
-
wrought teenager is likely to make. I t may have no
relevance whatever.ﬂ
ﬁI™d say it™s loaded with relevance,ﬂ Don said
gravely.

how does the other fellow look, M ister Cadee?ﬂ
ﬁ Worse than I do, M illie.ﬂ He thought of the fea
-
tures battered beyond recognition, down in the Cit y
M orgue.
ﬁ That ™s one I should have had tickets for,ﬂ she
smiled.
He gave her his hat and went toward the tiny bar.
Sibyl slid o˜ her stool. ﬁO ur table is ready.ﬂ She
peered anxiously at him. ﬁ You look terr ibly tired.ﬂ
ﬁB een dealing with some diˆcult people.ﬂ He
followed the headwaiter to the banquette, ordered a
double Rob R oy, br iefed Sibyl on the inter view with
Nor man R ettjer.
She said nothing until he had ˚nished, then
shook her head in disapproval.ﬁ You™ll only get your
-
self beaten up again, trying to trap them when you
hand over that ˚f t y thousand.They will be expec t
-
ing something like that or they wouldn™t have had
153
Grolheim war n you about not calling in the police.ﬂ
ﬁ That ™s right,ﬂ he admitted.ﬁBut I™m not planning
to tr ick them. Only to bargain with them. For Press
and My.ﬂ
ﬁHow can you bargain when you tur n over the
money?They ™ll have the cash and the coat... as well
as their prisoners.What can you o˜er them?ﬂ
ﬁBiggest thing in the wor ld, Sib. A chance for
their lives.They ™re facing that ar mchair, our modern
equivalent of the I ron Maiden. I may be able to show
them how to escape that: they won™t tur n down a
deal, you can bet on that.ﬂ
ﬁ That ™s like betting the lion won™t sneeze when
you have your head in its mouth. I don™t like any par t
of it, Don.ﬂ
ﬁI™m not exactly look ing forward to it myself.ﬂ
The smok y bite of the Scotch felt good to his throat.
ﬁ We may be able to work the thing out another way
before that six o™clock deadline ... in which case I
won™t need to make that rendezvous.ﬂ He told her
about the message from Captain Eadie, the call
from Stolz, the trip to the PsychWard, his talk with
Hamlin.
She forgot her sou˙é and her sherr y, listening
wide -eyed until he quoted the slasher™s cr yptic
explanation of her actions.
ﬁI k new I™d seen her picture in the paper recently.
Joyna R ettjer. O f course. It was a photograph of that
rock-and-roll mêlée at Greenwich.ﬂ
ﬁShe was arrested? I n Connecticut?ﬂ
ﬁ With a bunch of other teenage ter rors.They were
having one of those juvenile open-house shindigs –
and they began to out dare each other.ﬂ
154
ﬁ The if-you- don™t-you™re - chicken routine.ﬂ
ﬁ Yes. As I recall it, she and a couple of other haut
monde hoodlums drove somebody™s foreign spor ts
car along those black-top roads at seventy ; ˚nally
clipped a truck full of live tur keys and over tur ned it.
This R ettjer hellion and one of the other gir ls were
spor ting turkey feathers in their hair when the pho
-
tograph was taken ... I suppose at the police station.ﬂ
ﬁM ust have embar rassed the bejeezus out of our
philandering ˚nancier. And from the glimpse I had
of his haught y lady, I™d say it would have shocked
her r ight down to her patr ician heels.ﬂ He wor ked
on the London broil a moment.ﬁ That might have
given the brat an idea. All she™d have to do to get
her way would be to threaten another police cour t
appearance.ﬂ
ﬁBut how could she possibly decide on anything
as outr ight vicious as slashing valuable merchan
-
dise? And why pick on Ambletts?ﬂ
D on gave the waiter their order for baba au rhum
and co˜ee. ﬁS omehow Joyna must have heard about
her father™s a˜air with Lily Inez. Maybe felt he was
slighting darling daughter in favor of the sex y star.ﬂ
ﬁOr per haps,ﬂ Sibyl suggested,ﬁ the gir l simply
took her mother™s side of the triangular argument
Happens in the b.f.™s.ﬂ
ﬁEither way, she™d be burned up at Lily I nez. Espe
-
cially if she heard about that crown sable coat.ﬂ
ﬁGir ls a whole lot more stable emotionally than a
rock-and-roll teener might go green- eyed at lear ning
an older woman was going to get a present like that
from Papa. But how could she get even with Lily Inez
by ruining our hundred-dollar handbags?ﬂ
155
ﬁI™m going on guesswor k ,ﬂ he said.ﬁBut I think
what she meant by that crackŠ‚I™d have cut her to
r ibbons if I™d had the chance, but I couldn™t ™Šwas
that she had tried to scare her father into canceling
the order for the coat – and failed.Then she™d done
her damnedest to fr ighten Lily Inez into refusing
the sables – and also failed at thatŠ or was afraid
that she hadn™t succeeded. So as a last- ditch tr y, the
brat ™s twisted mind ˚xed on pressur ing her father by
threatening another humiliating run-in with the law
on a more serious charge than reck less dr iving.ﬂ
Sibyl didn™t understand.ﬁAre you saying Joyna
R ettjer arranged the hijacking?ﬂ
ﬁNo. Not that I™d put it past her. She may have set
the scheme in motion, intentionally or otherwise.
... I can™t tell. But I™d better bring you up to date.ﬂ
He related the details of the tête -à-tête in the star™s
dressing room, recited some of the jingles.
Sibyl repeated one, incredulously.
ﬁ
‚But don the sables once and I
Will guarantee that you will die.™
I t does sound high-schoolish.ﬂ
ﬁDidn™t sound so to M iss Inez.ﬂ
ﬁO f course not– those hor rible r hymes would
have made any woman a nervous wreck .ﬂ
ﬁCouldn™t have helped her beauty sleep much,ﬂ
D on said.ﬁB efore I left B ellevue I tried to reach
R ettjer by phone. His oˆce said he™d left for the day,
claimed they didn™t k now how I could get hold of
him.Then I tried the R ettjer residence on East Nine
-
t y-S econd. Butler there said none of the family were
156
home, told me that M issus Rettjer had gone to the
Bahamas.ﬂ
ﬁBut you said you saw her at the studio.ﬂ
ﬁI did. She was mad as hell about something.
On the hunt for her trouble-mak ing teenager, most
likely.Whether Joyna got her message through from
the hospital to her mother or her father, deponent
sayeth not Doc torVolney could have told me – but
he wasn™t listed in the Manhattan phone book ...

D oc tor Shlemm. He set me straight.Volney™s out in
Greenwich.ﬂ
ﬁ Where the Rettjer country place is.ﬂ
ﬁ They live at OldTown Point, rightVolney ™s oˆce
gave me that much, though they couldn™t say where
the doctor might be. And the telephone at OldTown
Point was dead as the old gray goose, too. S o – I™m
going out there r ight after I pay this check.ﬂ
ﬁI f you can talk to this gir l, you may be able to
unravel the whole ball of yar nŠI see that.ﬂ She
poked a for k , fretfully, at her baba au rhum.ﬁI t
seems as if I™ve wasted my morning.ﬂ
He reached across the table, caught hold of her
hand.ﬁSor r y. S elf- centered Cadee they call me down
at Centre Street. Please take an apology, Miss Forde.ﬂ
Sibyl smiled.ﬁI did latch onto something –
though it can™t be as important as what you found
out about that rock-and-roller.ﬂ
ﬁ Well, tell.ﬂ
ﬁI made about a dozen calls – the hauts coutu
-
r iers on Fift y-S eventh and upper Madison – but no
one could give me a lead about that turquoise gown.
Until I had what I modestly think was a middling
157
br ight idea.ﬂ
ﬁD on™t ˚sh. Fac ts ˚rst, pat on the back later.ﬂ
ﬁAll r ight. I thought where I™d go if I wanted to buy
a glamour gown like that... if I didn™t wor k at a high-
st yle store where I can get a discount.ﬂ
ﬁ Where?ﬂ
ﬁ To a secondhand shop.ﬂ
ﬁAh, now – ﬂ
ﬁBut a ver y super ior sort of secondhand shop.
One that doesn™t stock ordinary hand-me - downs.
Only the best. Dresses, coats, gowns, that came orig

inally from those swank y stores I™d just been visiting.
Where the ten best- dressed women tur n in their
only-wear-them-onces – and where a smar t woman
can sometimes pick up a ˚ve -hundred- dollar Schi

aparelli or Molyneux for a hundred or so.ﬂ
ﬁ There is such a markdown market?ﬂ
ﬁ There is. It ™s called My Cousin. I went there –
and they knew the turquoise gown immediately ;
they ™d sold it only a month ago.ﬂ
ﬁ You™re something, Sib.Who bought it?ﬂ
ﬁ They couldn™t tell me. Until, later. S aleslady
who sold it won™t be in until t wo. But they have
a record of all the original owners. And that tur

**MY COUSIN**

**ON THE WAY UP MADISON AVENUE IN THE TAXI SIBYL**

said:ﬁWhile I was waiting for you at the restaurant
I called up Ruth. I was afraid she might have heard
something on the radio about the police being after
Grolheim.ﬂ
ﬁHad she?ﬂ
ﬁShe™d been out and bought an after noon paper.ﬂ
ﬁLef t her low in the mind.ﬂ D on made it an assertion.
ﬁ Yes. But she didn™t say much. Except to wonder
if the kidnappers would think you had called in the
police. I told her they must know better. Was I wrong
to tr y and keep her hopes buoyed up?ﬂ
ﬁO f course not.ﬂ He thought of Ruth Preston™s
message to her husband:
ﬁ We are sitting tight, taking
no ac tion, until you get home.ﬂ
He™d agreed to go
along with that promise but he hadn™t stuck to his
word.The ac tion he™d taken up on West End Avenue
last night had probably been the spark that touched
o˜ M ax™s murder.Whether it would a˜ec t old Press
– that was a chance which had to be taken. ﬁI f Jim
159
is still alive, and if I can have a ˚ve minute talk with
these hijackers after the ransom is delivered, he™ll be
home by tomor row.ﬂ
ﬁAnd you?Will you come back safe and sound?ﬂ
The cab pulled in to the curb before he could do
more than sayﬁ Why not?ﬂŠthen he was helping her
out, paying the dr iver, glancing up at the ˛ower y
scr ipt letters in white against black glass:
**MY COUSIN**

(Once removed)
I n the modest display window was a single gown
of ˛aming orange tossed carelessly on a Direc toire
sofa of white satin.
ﬁNot the secondhand store of Second Avenue,
you see.ﬂ She led him inside.ﬁStan in show business
can™t a˜ord to wear a dress more than once, pub
-
licly. Downgrades‚em professionally. Still they can™t
a˜ord to buy a three -˚ft y impor t and give it to the

send their ‚old ™ clothes here on consignment; M y
Cousin takes a percentage and does ver y nicely
indeed.ﬂ
ﬁOnce removed,ﬂ D on said.ﬁ Very neat idea.ﬂ He
gazed at gowns on racks, er mine-tr immed capes on
manik ins, shimmering silk , ˚lmy lace, gold-embroi
-
dered brocade.
Sibyl spoke to a gray-haired woman in a linen
smock .The gray-haired woman went to the rear of
the store, retur ned with a small, dar k saleslady, also
in a smock.
ﬁM iss Nelty may be able to help you, M iss Forde.
160
M iss Nelty sold that sequined turquoise you asked
about.ﬂ
M iss Nelty was eager to be of assistance.Yes, she
remembered the gown, remembered the customer
who bought itﬁM issus Chadbourne. She bought the
shoes Miss I nez had made to go with the gown, too.ﬂ
Sibyl said: ﬁIs M issus Chadbourne a brunette?ﬂ
ﬁOh yes.The gown complimented her color ing
per fec tly.ﬂ
ﬁD o you keep a record,ﬂ asked Sibyl,ﬁof your
customers™ addresses? Can you tell us where Missus
Chadbourne lives?ﬂ
ﬁ We don™t keep any customer records. But we do
have a mailing list ... to notify our friends of items
which might par ticularly interest them. However ﬂŠ
the saleswoman was apologeticŠﬁI™m sure M issus
Chadbourne isn™t in our mail ˚le because she™s an
enter tainer, a singer; they move around so much,
you k now.ﬂ
ﬁ They certainly do,ﬂ Sibyl said.ﬁIs she on
television?ﬂ
ﬁI think she sings in a night club.ﬂ The sales
-
woman was vague.ﬁShe did mention it but I™ve
forgotten –TheTop Hat? No, that wasn™t it, but it
was something like that.ﬂ
D on said: ﬁ The H igh Note, per haps? On East
Fif t y-Fourth?ﬂ
The saleswoman smiled brightly.ﬁ That ™s it.The
H igh Note. How stupid of me– .ﬂ
ﬁEasy to get confused,ﬂ D on assured her. ﬁI sup
-
pose Missus Chadbourne has bought a number of
gowns here?ﬂ
ﬁQ uite a few, yes.ﬂ
161
ﬁAnd has sheﬂŠhe pursued the pointŠﬁ bought
several which had originally been owned by Lily
I nez?ﬂ
ﬁ Yes indeed. As a matter of fact, I believe that all
of her purchases were of numbers made especially
for M iss Inez.ﬂThe saleswoman nodded.
ﬁNow, how,ﬂ Sibyl asked him after they had
thanked the saleswoman and were again on the
street,ﬁhow in the wor ld did you guess that?ﬂ
ﬁNo guess at all.ﬂ He smiled.ﬁS cienti˚c probing.
Well, maybe not so scienti˚c.When I saw the sex y
lady at her apartment last night, I had the feeling
she k new more about the hijack than she™d admit.
Then, later, when she told me about those cockeyed
r hymes, I supposed that had been the infor mation
she™d been hiding.That was a dumb diagnosis,
though it took me a while to realize it. At the apart
-
ment she did her level best to postpone any police
investigation.ﬂ
ﬁ Wasn™t that a natural reac tion?ﬂ
ﬁI thought so, at ˚rst. She and that big-domed
manager of hers claimed they were only concer ned
about publicity, a scandal.That was the bunk ...
I was slow to catch on. She wisecracked about
R ettjer ™s going out to Las Vegas to be with her, said
she™d warned him he shouldn™t– but didn™t seem to
mind that it was k nown to the gossip scribblers.ﬂ
ﬁFeminine instinct? ... To make the best of a bad
situation?ﬂ
ﬁNot unless you call Rettjer ™s instincts femi
-
nine, too. He doesn™t str ike me that way. He made
it plain he didn™t care too much one way or the
other whether it became known he was giving her
162
a hundred-thousand-dollar gif t. And when you
come r ight down to it, it wouldn™t ac tually hurt her
professionally. She wouldn™t be the ˚rst actress to
pro˚t by being known as the mistress of a prominent
personage.ﬂ
ﬁI can think of several others,ﬂ Sibyl agreed.
ﬁ Think of how many phony publicity stories have
been planted in the press about ladies of the theater
having their jewels stolen. I t couldn™t really hur t her,
professionally, to hit the headlines in connection
with a crown sable coat. No, it wasn™t the possible
news break that scared her. But just when I™d man
-
aged to ˚gure that out, I learned about the screwball
daughter. I thought Lily Inez must have known about
Joyna and had been trying to smother that angle to
keep R ettjer from being hurt.ﬂ
ﬁBut now you don™t think so?ﬂ
ﬁHell, no. I™d told her one of the kidnappers had
been killed. Her manager had emphasized that the
police were in on the case. I f Lily Inez had thought
Joyna was involved, she™d have rushed to warn
R ettjer right away. I nstead she did all she could to
keep me from seeing him. So it ™s a cinch there™s
something else she™s holding back. All it could be is
that she knows one of the hijackers. M aybe the bru
-
nette who wore her old clothes, hah?ﬂ
A frown puckered Sibyl ™s forehead.ﬁI t could be
nothing more than the fact that Missus Chadbour ne
can wear Lily Inez ™ size without alterations, that she
likes the star™s taste in clothes. I f she bought one of
M iss Inez ™ wear-it- once -and-sell-it-down-the-r iver
gar ments – and liked it, she might well go back and
buy more from the same source.ﬂ
163
ﬁSure,ﬂ he said.ﬁSure. But how would she know
when one of the Lily- gilded items would be for sale?
She wasn™t on My Cousin™s mailing list.ﬂ
ﬁ Well, she might haunt the place. If she could
get a ˚ve -hundred- dollar exclusive for a third of its
or iginal price, it would be wor th it. I™m only tr ying
to see all sides of it. But the side that impresses me
is that the gir l who helped to steal Lily Inez™ sables
also wears her hand-me-downs.You hit the nail on
the head, you™re probably right about some connec
-
tion between them. Now all we have to do is locate
M issus Chadbourne.ﬂ
ﬁM ay not be so simple.ﬂ He ˛agged a cab.ﬁPar k
Avenue and Fif t y-four th,ﬂ he told the driver.
Sibyl looked at him out of the cor ners of her eyes.
ﬁ You seem to k now a lot about this H igh Note; you™ve
never taken me there.ﬂ
ﬁNever been in the joint in my life, shugie. But I
k now what it™ll be like. Horseshoe bar with a baby
grand inside. R aised banquettes so the patrons can
see the singer under the baby spot. Dim blue lighting
so you can™t see the high prices on the liquor list.
And ver y dim, ver y blue lyrics.ﬂ
ﬁD oesn™t sound ter r ibly attrac tive. How much
would a – a chanteuse earn in a place like that?ﬂ
ﬁNo idea. But I shouldn™t think it would be enough
to pay for many of M y Cousin™s fanc y costumes.ﬂ
The cab stopped at a sidewalk awning decorated
with quarter notes, clefs, piano keyboards.The
dr iver said:
ﬁI t ain™t open till ˚ve.You want me to take you
somewheres else?ﬂ
D on said: ﬁNo, thanks.This is it.ﬂ He helped Sibyl
164
out.
The front door was locked. Inside a solitary light
showed above a bank of chromium- capped bottles.
A ˚gure moved in the gloom beyond.
D on rapped on the glass with a quarter.
A face emerged from the shadows, approached
the door. A round, pale, unhappy face with sad eyes.
The eyes studied them, examined Sibyl, seemed sat
-
is˚ed.The door was opened an inch.
ﬁ We don™t open untilŠﬂ
ﬁ We just want to ask a question,ﬂ D on said
quick ly. ﬁGir l we k now used to sing here – name, of
Chadbourne. K now her?ﬂ
ﬁShe ain™t here no more.ﬂThe sad eyes showed no
interest.
ﬁCan you tell us where we can ˚nd her?ﬂ Sibyl
asked.
ﬁI heard she ain™t in the business any more.
S omebody said she went out to LasVegas couple
weeks ago, hit all the jackpots in town.ﬂThe fat face
creased into a smile.ﬁM aybe I should go out there,
tr y my luck. Can™t be no worse™n it is here.ﬂ
165
## CHAPTER 25

**C AKED WITH BLOOD**

SIBYL MUSED:ﬁ WONDER IF MY PAL GEOFF MIGHT
have some dope on another enter tainer who was in
LasVegas at the same time Lily Inez was?ﬂ
ﬁUh-uh. A High Note singer wouldn™t interest a
columnist like Geo˜rey unless she was outstanding
– and I don™t mean her ˚gure. Or unless she, too,
was letting Rettjer buy her chips.ﬂ Don steered her
toward Lexington Avenue.
ﬁHow little you understand the dista˜ side. No
woman who was tr ying to take Rettjer away from Lily
I nez would be stupid enough to buy and wear her
r ival ™s discarded gowns. I t couldn™t have been that
way. But what if R ettjer™s wife hired this Missus Chad
-
bour ne to follow the love birds out there to round up
evidence for a divorce?ﬂ
ﬁSlim possibility. I™ll check on it when I get out to
Greenwich. Rettjer went to some pains to convince
me his wife doesn™t care enough about him to have
him trailed.ﬂ
ﬁNever underestimate a woman who™s about to
166
lose a ˚ft y-million-dollar husband. M aybe she™s not
jealous; she can still be money-minded. Are you
going to dr ive out to Old Town Point?ﬂ
ﬁI f you™ll lend me the Porsche. I have an idea Lieu
-
tenant Dimmock may have one of his boys keeping
an eye on my car.ﬂ
ﬁ Why don™t you let me drive you?ﬂ
ﬁI™d like nothing better, Sib. But we™ll have to
postpone it.You™re needed at the store. Alice will be
doing nipups trying to cope with those cops. How
about giving her a buzz now? S ee if you can ˚nd out
how Baisha Gates made out with Dimmock.ﬂ
ﬁAll r ight.ﬂ Sibyl followed him into the cigar store
on the cor ner, lef t the door of the phone booth open
so he could hear.
ﬁProtec tion Oˆce, please – Hello, B ecky? –
Can you speak freely? Or is that sergeant still in
your hair? – Oh, he has – Yes? –Yes? – And the
other one? – No! – With Miss G ates? – I™ll tell him
– How ™s Al making out? ... I can believe it. ... Short-
handed is right. ... No, he won™t. ... Yes, I will – Half
hour or so – . Of course – . ‚B y.ﬂ
She pushed the door wide open, stayed on the
shelf seat.ﬁ They ™ve relaxed the watch on the Rhine.
The lieutenant ™s still with Miss G ates in Mister
Grolheim™s oˆce; they ™ve been in a huddle for three
quar ters of an hour, already.ﬂ
ﬁD on™t like that.ﬂ
ﬁNo. But Baisha™s not the only one having her
troubles. Al™s standing on her head. Mister Stolz is
raising the roof because he can™t get in touch with
you. M ore calls from the aisles than you and I and
Press usually handle.Two detainees in the Inter view
167
R oom r ight now. And that Homicide sergeant has
been taking all the calls at B ecky ™s phone, up to a
few minutes ago.ﬂ
ﬁ Then what?ﬂ
ﬁB eck y doesn™t k now. S omeone called in. Quin
-
ton asked some questions. Among other things he
asked‚Hotel Her ford?™ Šthen after a bit he hung up,
grabbed his hat, and left.ﬂ
ﬁH m. I like that even less.Wonder who was tele
-
phoning him about my hotel?ﬂ
ﬁB eck y thought it was a woman calling.ﬂ Sibyl
dropped a dime in the slot, dialed her garage.ﬁCould
it have been Ruth Preston?ﬂ
ﬁD oubt it.ﬂ
ﬁShe rang you there last night.ﬂ
ﬁSure, but she™d be the last person to unburden
herself to anyone who might be a police oˆcer. Ruth
k nows our oˆce routine; she™d recognize a strange
voice. No, it wouldn™t have been Ruth.ﬂ
Sibyl spoke to the garage, lef t orders for the
spor ts car to be ready on the street, hung up.
D on said: ﬁChances are there™s been a plain-
clothes man hanging around the Herford for a
couple of hours, hoping I™d show up. I don™t want to
oblige the Homicide squad that much. But I can™t
forget that M ax took the key to my hotel room along
with all my clothes.ﬂ
She stared at him.ﬁ You think one of the others
may have gone to your room, planted something for
the police to pick up?ﬂ
ﬁAfraid so.ﬂ
ﬁ Then – why don™t I go there, beat the sergeant
to it?ﬂ
168
He said: ﬁI couldn™t ask you to stick your neck out
like that.ﬂ
ﬁ You didn™t ask me. I volunteered.ﬂ
ﬁI t ™s a real r isk , Sib.Whoever spotted me coming
out of My ™s house this morning saw you with me.
M aybe the description of you wasn™t suˆcient for
Dimmock to recognize you. But there may have been
additional identi˚cation by now.ﬂ
ﬁD on™t be silly. I f there had been, Quinton would
have been asking Al or Beck y a million questions
about me; he saw me walk out of your oˆce this
mor ning. Let ™s get a move on.ﬂ
They caught a cab.
ﬁHow will I get in your room?ﬂ
ﬁGive me one of your cards, your Protec tion
cards.ﬂ He scribbled on it. ﬁD on™t go to the desk. At
the r ight as you go in the lobby is a little stand like a
minister ™s pulpit.ﬂ
ﬁ The bell captain™s station.ﬂ
ﬁR ight. Ask forTommy. I f he™s not around, Hap.
Either one™ll get the key from the desk. Just give‚em
this card.ﬂ
ﬁ What ™ll I look for when I get in?ﬂ
He scowled blankly at the photograph of the
dr iver in the license frame.ﬁNo idea. My clothes, per
-
haps; they™d be sort of stained; they might be used
to show I™d had a run-in with Max. Just have to use
your head. Of course, if there™s anything around that
doesn™t belong to me – that ™ll be the plant.ﬂ
ﬁD o I hide whatever it is?ﬂ
ﬁ You couldn™t hide anything in a hotel room from
a fellow like Quinton. He™d k now all the places.
No. Br ing it with you ... if you can.ﬂ He put his arm
169
around her shoulders.ﬁI don™t like this at all – but I
can™t ˚gure any other way to work k . O f course this
idea of a plant may be wrong.ﬂ
She squeezed the hand on her shoulder. ﬁI won™t
have much time.What if Q uinton™s there before me?ﬂ
ﬁ Tommy or Hap will know.They don™t miss a tr ick,
those bellhops. But once you™re in the room you™ll
have to hurr y.ﬂ
ﬁ Where™ll you wait for me?ﬂ
ﬁI n the cab. Around the cor ner. On Fif t y-six th.ﬂ
The taxi stopped at the marquee with the giant
Her ford in multicolored glass.
D on said: ﬁI™ve been thinking.The plant might be
something of Grolheim™s.To tie me in with him.ﬂ
Sib hopped out.ﬁI won™t be long.ﬂ
ﬁD on™t be. G ood luck .ﬂ
The cab rolled on around the cor ner.
D on smoked a cigarette, keeping an eye out for
the sergeant.The t win streams of pedestrians pour
-
ing past the cab in opposite directions, crowding,
jostling, seemed like the leads that were tur ning
up in this mixed-up, multiple crime Šrobbery,
k idnapping, murder.The motives of the hijackers
were car rying them in one direc tion; they were in
it for what they could get out of it in cash; they had
been hired or, at least, tipped o˜ to the possibility
of stealing the sables. But it seemed clear now that
someone had suggested the theft for purposes of his
or her own, purposes having nothing to do with the
loot, having much to do with jealousies and hatreds.
I t shouldn™t be diˆcult to round up M ax™s com
-
panion, the man with the bulgy spaniel eyes and the
broken nose and the nasty smile. I t cer tainly would
170
be easy to br ing Missus Chadbourne to book , now
her name, her description, and her profession were
k nown. All that was needed was the assurance that
Press and My were out of the hijackers™ hands – the
rest was police routine.
But how about the instigator of the triple cr ime?
Who™ was the original guilty par ty?
The pneumatic hammers began pounding with
venomous fury ; he began to feel new aches from the
beating. He had an overpower ing feeling that Sib
wasn™t coming back to the cab, that the police were
landing her, questioning her – when he should be
the one to undergo that ordeal.
He looked at his watch. Only seven minutes since
she™d hurr ied into the Herford lobby. H is watch must
have stopped. No, still running.
Then he saw her. She was carr ying his suitcase;
passers-by were showing astonishment at a prett y
gir l lugging a suitcase.
He jumped out, took the valise.
ﬁAny trouble, shug?ﬂ He helped her in.
ﬁNo,ﬂ she said.ﬁ Tommy was ˚ne. He went up with
me, stood guard outside in the cor r idor.ﬂ
ﬁ What ™s in here?ﬂ He tapped the suitcase.
ﬁAn overcoat,ﬂ she said.ﬁI t was under your bed.
All rolled up.ﬂ
ﬁGrolheim™s?ﬂ
ﬁNo. I t™s an oxford gray.With black velvet lapels.ﬂ
ﬁJim Preston™s!ﬂ D on had seen it a thousand
times.
Sibyl nodded, leaned toward him, whisperingŠ
ﬁ The collar is simply caked with blood!ﬂ

**OLD TOWN FARM**

**THE SPORTS CARTOOKTHE PARKWAY HILLS LIKE A**

swallow, soaring and swooping. A freezing drizzle
glazed the windshield, coating the highway with
treacherous silver. Nevertheless, D on kept the
speedometer at six t y.
He was becoming steadily more gloomy at the
probable signi˚cance of Jim Preston™s overcoat. It
could not have been, as he had thought for a while, a
war ning that any fur ther investigative activit y might
endanger Press™s life. For if that had been the pur
-
pose of the plant, there would have been no point
in tipping o˜ the Homicide sergeant to a search of
D on™s room at the Her ford.The only other possibility
was that someone was determined to connec t Don
with the kidnapping.
The patter n was plain.Two of Ambletts™ men had
been in charge of the crown sable garment when
it had been snatched. Don had k nown about the
plans for its deliver y. One of the hijackers had been
found murdered in the home of Ambletts™ buyer.
172
Grolheim had made at least four phone calls which
might be inter preted as putting him in partnership
with the criminals. D on himself had been forced into
the unfortunate position of withholding important
infor mation from the police. The implication of an
inside job, with Ambletts employees conniving at the
scheme, could scarcely be stronger. I f the overcoat
had been found by Q uinton it would have bolstered
the suspicions aroused when someone had recog
-
nized D on at the time he left Grolheim™s house.
He decided that it had been Missus Chadbourne
who must have gone to his hotel room, equipped
with the key Max had taken. The other man, the
fellow with the broken nose and the bulgy spaniel
eyes, would most likely have had to keep watch over
Grolheim. Unless the original gang had been com
-
posed of more than three, only the brunette would
have been available to plant the bloodstained over
-
coat.Why had she run a risk like that? How could she
have dared to gamble that Don would not be in the
room? Or had she been prepared to bargain with him
if she had found him there?
The odds, he thought, were that if he had caught
her in the Herford, she would have tr ied to talk her
way out, relying on the fact that she had almost
cer tainly saved his life. There was even the remote
chance that she was ready to break with Broken
Nose, unable to stomach the assault on Press, the
murder of Max.
Per haps she sensed that time was running out,
that she™d better get on the right side of the law as
fast as she could before she landed in a cell. M aybe
she had suggested to Q uinton that she would tur n
173
state™s evidence, had given him the tip- o˜ about the
planted overcoat as proof of her intentions.
You™re tr ying to look at her actions in the best light
because you wouldn™t be here now, rocketing out to
Greenwich, if she hadn™t risked her own life to save
yours. Use some common sense! That plant meant she
was tr ying to put you in the middle. To make it look as
if you had slugged old Press!
All the way to the Connecticut state line he
brooded about his part in the ransom deal. I f any
-
thing should go wrong with the delivery of that ˚ft y
thousand, it would be taken as convincing proof that
he was in cahoots with the kidnappers. And there
were a thousand ways in which it might go wrong.
There was only the slimmest hope that Sibyl
would be able to dig up enough information about
M issus Chadbourne in time to trace her before the
money had to be handed over. Sib would be up at
S ar i Soeurs now, descr ibing the brunette and the
mink , but even if the swank y store came through
with an address, it was far from likely that M issus
Chadbourne would be found there. B esides, the
probabilities were that the mink, too, had been
acquired from M y Cousin.
I t was after four when he cut o˜ the highway,
raced over black-top roads to the estate section of
OldTown Point. A query to a rural mailman brought
the answer:
ﬁM ister Rettjer ™s place?Why, this is it, right here.
All this, hereﬂŠwith a wide sweep of handŠﬁbut the
entrance is half a mile along, on the right. Sign at the
gate says
OldTown Far mŠRegistered Angus Cattle
.
Y ™can™t miss it.ﬂ
174
D on drove on. Long white fences, fat black cattle
in still-green fescue, gray sheep moving slowly
against a brown hillside, a high ornamental iron gate
bar r ing the winding drive.The gate was locked.
He par ked, got out of the car.There was no gate
tender ™s house, no bell to r ing, no box-housed
telephone.
They don™t seem to expect visitors. But you haven™t
come this far to be balked by a gate.
He climbed over the fence beside the Angus
sign, slogged along the sleety gravel between bare -
limbed oaks and elms to a white G eorgian house
with spruce and cedar guarding the tall columns, the
deep porch beneath the balcony.There were two
cars in a big garage, but no sign of life.
The brass knocker made a resounding clatter.
For a minute he thought he was going to be ignored;
then a butler gotten up in genuine British coun
-
tr y-house style opened the door, regarded D on with
eyes like a halibut™s.
ﬁM issus Rettjer?ﬂ
The butler™s eyes searched the driveway for the
conveyance which had brought the visitor. ﬁ The
house is not open, sir.ﬂ
ﬁI didn™t take the trouble of hiking in here to
look at the antiques,ﬂ Don said.ﬁ Tell Missus R ettjer
that Cadee of Ambletts wants to see her about her
daughter. Go on. Sk ip the protocol.Tell her.ﬂ
ﬁI– ah – ﬂ the butler opened his mouth, closed
it.ﬁ You will excuse me – ﬂ He shut the door also.
The sleet rattled against the whitewashed brick
and the stor m windows; there was no other sound
for a good two minutes.
175
What do you do if they give you the complete brush-
o˜? Tr y the back door? G o in a second-stor y window?
O ˜er to poke that butler in the nose?
The door opened abruptly. ﬁM issus R ettjer is
indisposed. But she will see you for one minute.ﬂ
Pu˜y lids closed over the halibut eyes.ﬁIf you will
come to the librar y –ﬁ
Helen Rettjer did not seem ill. She seemed
haught y and tense and bitter. She wore the t weed
sk ir t and a heather ish sweater ; Don noticed with
sur pr ise that her hair was a glossy chestnut, combed
back severely from a high forehead. I t made her
look younger but heightened her expression of aris
-
tocratic distaste. She remained standing beside a
cher r y escritoire.
ﬁI understand the reason for your wishing to see
my daughter, Mister Cadee.That is neither possible
nor desirable. Joyna is in a private sanitarium under
the care of our physician, Doc torVolney; she will be
there for a considerable time. I think it unnecessar y
to add that she has hurt her father and mother far
more than she hurt your store. For that, of course,
I am ready to make full payment ﬂŠshe touched an
open check book on the writing deskŠﬁif you will tell
me the amount of the damages.ﬂ
D on shook his head.ﬁI can™t tell you what the
amount will be, M issus Rettjer. I didn™t come here as
a collection agent.You will hear from our Accounting
D epartment on that. But there are other charges
much more serious than slashing merchandise.ﬂ
M issus Rettjer held up a hand imperiously.ﬁM y
daughter has been pronounced by thoroughly
competent psychiatr ists as in no way mentally
176
responsible for her ac tions.The child has been
brought to the verge of a nervous collapse because
of a situation which your store helped to br ing
about. No, noﬂŠ she ˛uttered her ˚ngersŠﬁdon™t
contradic t me. Ambletts was morally responsible for
a betrayal of one of its good customersŠI™ve dealt
with you since I was mar r iedŠin order to make a few

-
tress. Don™t deny it; I k now all about it; my daughter
k new all about it... she was dr iven half craz y by the
k nowledge that her father was wiling to break up our
home on account of this cheap little actress. Joyna
k new your store was helping this tawdr y a˜air along,
for a pro˚t, by mak ing up an ex travagant crown
sable coat. I n her childish way she attempted to pre
-
vent her father from making a fool of himself. Failing
in that, she ˛ew o˜ the handle and tried to take her
resentment out on the goods on your counters. I cer
-
tainly can™t condone her actions; still I don™t blame
her in the least. I myself have considered taking
much more stringent ac tion in the matter.ﬂ
ﬁUp to and including murder?ﬂ D on said.
She froze into a sor t of cataleptic rigidity, abso
-
lutely motionless except for the widening of her
eyes, the slight ˛ar ing of her nostrils. The patr i
-
cian features became rosy pink, deep red, almost
pur plish.
ﬁM urder?ﬂ Her lips formed the word but he could
not hear her until she said in a choked voice:ﬁ Who
was murdered?ﬂ
177
## CHAPTER 27

**MISS JOYNA RET TJER**

DON SAID,ﬁ THE GARMENTYOU BLAME MY STORE
for selling was stolen last night. One of the robbers
was found beaten to death in a house in New Yor k
this mor ning.ﬂ
Helen Rettjer put a hand on the escritoire to
steady herself, tur ned away so he could only see her
pro˚le.Then she stepped around the desk, sank into
the chair behind it.
She didn™t know that – or else she™s putting on a
ver y good act.
ﬁ The victim was a teenager named
M axTillson, only a couple of years older than your
daughter. When the police ˚nd out that Miss R ettjer
slashed a lot of our merchandise because she was
sore at Ambletts for selling the coat to her father,
they ™ll be likely to inquire whether she knew this
dead boy. Whether she had put him up to hijack ing
the coat.ﬂ
ﬁJoyna had nothing whatever to do with it, I can
assure you. Nothing.ﬂ She regained some of her
poise. ﬁMy daughter ™s resentment took a di˜erent
178
course.To be absolutely frank , she did consider
in˛ic ting an injury upon this oversexed creature with
whom her father is infatuated.ﬂThe apoplectic color
faded from the haught y features.ﬁAs a matter of
fac t, last Sunday Joyna actually went to the studio
where this person rehearses, with the intention of
doing her bodily damage. For tunately she didn™t
˚nd the notor ious woman, so no harm was done.
However, when I learned what Joyna had intended,
I immediately put her under Doc torVolney™s care
and tr ied to keep her here at home. But this morning
she managed to slip out and hitch a ride to the city.
S o I had to rush in to the studio myself, to war n this
woman to beware of my daughter.ﬂ
ﬁI™m a store detec tive, Missus R ettjer, not a police
-
man. I™m only, concer ned about two of Ambletts™
men who were k idnapped last night while they were
deliver ing this coat. But if I were a cop, I™d wonder
if a gir l with your daughter ™s tendenc y to violence
might not also have planned the hijacking, the
k idnapping.ﬂ
ﬁNo, no, no! My child has no unnatural tenden
-
cies at all. She only meant to protec t me, to prevent
her father from break ing up her home.ﬂ Her shoul
-
ders sagged, her head bent for ward, she sounded
whipped, defeated.ﬁNothing that happened was
my daughter ™s fault.The blame rests entirely on
her father and on me.Though I will say in my own
defense that whatever I did was entirely for Joyna™s
sake, so she should not lose her inheritance in the
event of a separation between Nor man and me.ﬂ
ﬁ What did you do?ﬂ
She lifted the lid of the escritoire, reached into the
179
compar tment beneath. ﬁI didn™t ac tually do it myself.
There are things one prefers to pay others to do.ﬂ
She brought out a t yped sheet of paper.ﬁI ar ranged
to have this woman put under surveillance so I might
be prepared with evidence of the ex tent to which she
would go to alienate my husband™s a˜ec tions – not
that there has been any real a˜ec tion between us for
a long time.ﬂ
ﬁ You hired a keyhole snooper?ﬂ
The cor ners of her mouth curved down.ﬁI prefer
to say a reputable investigating agency, recom
-
mended by my law yers.ﬂ
ﬁI k now that k ind of detec tive.ﬂ He was purposely
caustic.
ﬁI t is my impression that all detec tives are much
alike,ﬂ she retor ted wearily.ﬁI n any event, this is one
of the later repor ts sent to me. I t is dated November
six th from LasVegas, Nevada.ﬂ She read rapidly in a
taut voice:
ﬁOperative learned last night from
conversation between subject of inves
-
tigation and Mister R. that he is
having made for her a crown sable
coat worth in neighborhood of one
hundred thousand to be presented on
occasion of her birthday, November

by Ambletts Fifth Avenue. Subject of
investigation protested she would
rather have hundred-dollar ring for

to. Reply of Mister R. was blurred on
180
tape by radio then turned on in room.ﬂ
She refolded the sheet, replaced it in the com
-
par tment, closed the lid.ﬁI had no intention of
telling Joyna this, but the child came in my room
while I was telephoning. She found it and read it. It
near ly drove her craz y to discover that her father was
planning to leave me.ﬂ
ﬁ What did you do af ter you lear ned about the
crown sables?ﬂ
ﬁNothing.ﬂ She lowered her eyes.ﬁ What could I
do? Make a scene in my husband™s oˆce? Pull the
creature™s hair? All I wanted was to lead my own life
quietly here in my home ... to see to it that Joyna™s
future was not jeopardized. What do you think I
could have done?ﬂ
He eyed her steadily.ﬁA wife who™d hire a snooper
to spy on another woman might not be above hir ing
someone to steal a hundred-thousand-dollar gif t
meant for the other woman.ﬂ
She didn™t lift her head.ﬁDraw whatever conclu
-
sions you please about me. But be careful. I f you
attempt to accuse my daughter of complicit y in this
– this theft and k idnapping and murder – you will
be wrong and you will be sorr y.ﬂ
ﬁI™ll be sorr y if you™re holding back any infor ma
-
tion that might help us to get Ambletts™ men back
safe and sound.ﬂ
ﬁI must ask you to leave now.ﬂ
The butler was in the doorway instantly.
D on scowled at him, followed him to the front
door, strode across the porch, down the sleeted
dr iveway.
181
She was doing her damnedest to protec t her
daughter. Rettjer had covered up for his wife, hand
-
ing out all that hoopla about how disinterested she
was. Hadley™s hell-bent to shield his star, his bread
and butter.While the ones who really need protec
-
tion are Jim Preston and My Grolheim. And time is
running out on the clock– .
He thought about LasVegas, the pr ivate eye,
M issus Chadbourne. Maybe Broken Nose was some
-
one she had picked up out there, a stick man in a
gambling house, perhaps.Yet M ax had been a local.
He had climbed the rail fence, had almost
reached the car before he saw the gir l, huddled
down in the front seat.
ﬁHey,ﬂ Joyna called.ﬁI thought you were never
coming.ﬂ
ﬁI thought you were in a booby hatch
somewhere.ﬂ
ﬁD on™t be silly. M other told you that. She™s such a
liar.You™ve no idea the lies she tells.ﬂ She beckoned.
ﬁI owe you an apology. Drive me to Greenwich while
I explain.ﬂ
He opened the door, edged beneath the wheel,
was putting the key in the switch before he noticed
the blued muzzle peeping from under her raspber
-
r y- colored raincoat
ﬁAnother stick-up?ﬂ he asked quietly.
ﬁFar be it.This is to keep you from having me
ar rested again. And don™t fool yourself : it ™s loaded
and the safet y ™s o˜ and I know how to use it and I
will if you don™t behave.ﬂ
ﬁI never make passes at a gir l with a gun.ﬂ
She giggled.ﬁ You™re cute.You™re a bastard but
182
you™re cute.ﬂ
He started the spor ts car, got it rolling.ﬁ What
were you going to explain?ﬂ
Joyna sniggered again.ﬁFirst of all, that you™re
going to dr ive me in to NewYor k , not Greenwich.ﬂ
ﬁ Your mother will have the troopers after you in
nothing ˛at.ﬂ
ﬁSure. So we™ll go over to the Post R oad and in on
the Bronx River Par k way.They won™t be look ing for
me there – and anyhow they don™t k now what k ind
of car you™re driving. Is this your car? I t™s cute.ﬂ
ﬁEnd of explanation?ﬂ
ﬁNo, there™s more. But ˚rst I have to k now what
lies mother told you.ﬂ
ﬁ That you were under a doctor ™s care.ﬂ
ﬁHoh! She™s the one who™s a mental case. Not me.
I suppose she told you she didn™t k now anything
about the present my father is giving that television
bitch.ﬂ
ﬁShe read me a repor t from a pr ivate detec tive in
Las Vegas.ﬂ
ﬁDid she tell you about the ˚ght I had with my
father about Silly Inez?ﬂ
ﬁNo.When was that?ﬂ
ﬁLast night. O utside the apartment house where
she lives.ﬂ
ﬁ What time?ﬂ
ﬁAbout half-past seven or so. Oh, I screamed and
car r ied on something frightful. But it didn™t do any
good. He just told me I needed a good whaling – .ﬂ
ﬁHe might have something there.ﬂ
ﬁHoh! I™d like to see any man try it– unless I
wanted him to. Any way, I couldn™t stop my father
183
from going to her goddamn bir thday part y but I gave
her fair war ning what I™d do if she wore that god
-
damn coat.ﬂ
ﬁ You gave her a number of war nings, didn™t you?
Those jer k jingles?ﬂ
She squealed in delight.ﬁHow did you k now?
Prett y cute, weren™t they? Did Silly Inez show them
to you?ﬂ
ﬁ Y e p .ﬂ
ﬁShe didn™t show you the best one, though. She
hasn™t even heard it yet.ﬂ Joyna chanted in a shrill
sing-song:
ﬁ
‚ You think you™ll be dressed up to k ill
But I™m the one who really will.™
ﬁHow do you like that?ﬂ
ﬁK id stu˜,ﬂ he said.
ﬁHoh!You think so? She won™t think so.That ™s
what I™m going to recite to her just before I use this
gun on her tonight.ﬂ

## CHAPTER 28

**DELIVEREDTO MISS INEZ**

**DON SWUNG THE SPORTS CAR INTO THE STREAM OF**

trucks and trac tor trailers on the Post R oad. It was
almost dark and much colder; the sleet had turned
to a hard, gr itt y snow.ﬁTrouble with you is, you
haven™t any more sense than to mean it.ﬂ
ﬁ Why shouldn™t I mean it!ﬂ Joyna cried.ﬁI™m not
going to let that Silly Inez steal my father!ﬂ
ﬁ You won™t see much of your father if you shoot
her.They ™d put you where you couldn™t sk ip out as
easily as you did from your home just now.ﬂ
ﬁ They wouldn™t do much to me if I kill her.ﬂ
ﬁ Think not?ﬂ
ﬁI™d get o˜ easy.They ™d have to tr y me in Juvenile
Cour t; I™m underage.Those judges would be pigeons
for me.ﬂ She put a sob in her voice.ﬁI was brought
up in a broken home ... I did it to keep M ommy and
Daddy together.ﬂ
ﬁ You were brought up spoiled rotten.You™re
ac ting like this because you™re not getting as much
attention as you™d like. Any judge would see through
185
your tantrums in a minute.ﬂ
Joyna laughed.ﬁ That ™s what you think . I™d cr y
and rave and fall o˜ the stand in a faint. B esides,
my father can a˜ord to hire the best psychiatrists to
prove I™m not morally responsible for my ac ts.ﬂ She
moaned piteously.ﬁEver ything went black ... I don™t
remember pulling the trigger.ﬂ
ﬁ You™re not going to pull any tr igger.ﬂ
ﬁNo? Hoh! Wait and see.ﬂ She slid away from him.
ﬁ Think you can get the gun away from me?ﬂ
ﬁI™ll let your father do that. I™m going to take you
to him.ﬂ
ﬁ Yeah?ﬂ She sneered skeptically.ﬁ Where?ﬂ
ﬁAt M iss Inez ™ apartment.ﬂ
ﬁNo k idding! You mean that? Can you get in the
Buck inghurst? I couldn™t.They even put me out of
the elevator when I tried to go up to tell her o˜.ﬂ She
was excited.
ﬁI™ll get you in, all right.Your father™s going to
meet me there at six.ﬂ
ﬁ What for?ﬂ
ﬁ We have some business to discuss.ﬂ
ﬁIs it about that goddamn coat?ﬂ
ﬁ That ™s right.You™d like to have those sables your
-
self, wouldn™t you?ﬂ
ﬁNo,ﬂ she snapped.ﬁ You think I™m envious of her.
Well, I am, but not about any lousy coat. Shows how
smar t you aren™t, you just don™t understand me.
Nobody does, not even mother.ﬂ She sulked, shr ink
-
ing as far away from him as possible.
He made no attempt at conversation.The sports
car crossed the bridge into M anhattan, sped down
the East Side expressway.
186
Not until they had turned west ward in a press of
ear ly- evening traˆc did Joyna speak again:
ﬁ You™re tr ying to tr ick me.ﬂ
ﬁ Why should I?ﬂ
ﬁB ecause you want to keep me away from Silly
I nez.ﬂ
ﬁI want to keep you from causing any more trou
-
ble. If it hadn™t been for you, a couple of my fr iends
wouldn™t have been kidnapped last night.ﬂ
ﬁI don™t k now what you™re talk ing about.ﬂ
He braked down for a red light at Par k Avenue.
ﬁ You k now MaxTillson, don™t you? Fr iend of yours,
wasn™t he? Kid who got killed last night?ﬂ
ﬁOh!ﬂ She ˛ung open the door at her side, sprang
out, leaped in front of a car just beginning to roll; the
light had changed. Half a dozen hor ns began honk
-
ing impatiently.
D on reached over, closed the far door, let in the
clutch. He couldn™t hop out and chase her, leaving
Sib™s car to block traˆc. Even if he should cor ner the
gir l, there was the gun to consider.
You should have taken the pistol away from her.
She believes all that gu˜ she was giving you about
getting o˜ easy if she uses that gun. She has no more
moral sense than a cobra.
But he couldn™t decide whether or not she had
˛ed on account of his mention of MaxTillson. By
the time he parked at the Buck inghurst he was still
debating the possibility that she had spark-plugged
the ser ies of crimes.
The big doorman, who had told him about Sally,
was on duty but the night super was not yet at the
desk .The day man phoned upstairs, gave him the
187
nod to the elevator.
Frances let him in. ﬁM iss Inez is not here. But she
told me you were expec ted. Please make yourself
comfor table.ﬂ She was polite but no more. ﬁM ay I
br ing you a dr ink?ﬂ
ﬁS cotch, if you have some. On the rocks.ﬂ He
dropped into one of the low-slung chairs, thinking
how much more pleasant than this lush decor was
the warm coziness of Sibyl Forde™s place.
The cr ystal clock on the mantel said ˚ve minutes
to six.
When the maid brought the whisky, he said: ﬁ You
k now a private eye has been keeping tabs on your
mistress and her admirer, Frances?ﬂ
ﬁNo.ﬂ She was star tled. ﬁI did not k now this.ﬂ
ﬁHe k nows all about the Las Vegas goings on. You
went to Nevada with Miss I nez?ﬂ
ﬁBut of course. I go every where she goes.ﬂ
ﬁR emember meeting a woman name of
Chadbourne?ﬂ
ﬁI don™t k now anyone named Chadbourne.ﬂ
He sampled the scotch. ﬁNo?Thought you might.
She was one of the gang that stole Miss I nez ™ birth
-
day present. I™ve been told M issus Chadbourne was
in Las Vegas same time you were.ﬂ
Frances tossed her head de˚antly. ﬁI f you imagine
I gave this woman any infor mation, you are crazy.
I keep my mouth shut. I talk to no one of Miss I nez.
And of this stealing, I know not one thing.ﬂ
ﬁ You must have heard something out in the cor r i
-
dor last night.ﬂ He ˚nished the liquor.ﬁ There™d have
been quite a commotion out there, a light. One man
was k nocked out. And you were expec ting someone
188
to ar r ive just about then.ﬂ
ﬁ Yes. Miss I nez was.ﬂ She hesitated, then the
words tumbled out.ﬁI will tell you, even if it costs me
my job ŠI will tell you the truth. I was in the dressing
room, hanging up some things.ﬂ She gestured.ﬁ The
dressing room is nex t the hall, what you call the
cor r idor. I hear a bump and a shout, then another
bump. I hurr y to hang up the things I have, then I go
out to the kitchen and listen at the service door. I t is
all quiet. I open the door and there is no one there.
No one. Nothing. I think it must be gremlins or my
imagination. But when I come back to the living
room to tell Miss I nez, there is M ister R ichard.ﬂ
ﬁR ichard?ﬂ
ﬁShe calls him that so no one will know his name.
He has just come in from the other elevator. He is
explaining something to M iss I nez but he stops when
he sees me. H is tie is untied, his collar is unbuttoned.
And there is blood on his chin.ﬂ
A buzzer sounded. She ran to the foyer, opened
the door. ﬁG ood evening,ﬂ she said.
The phone rang. D on went to the gilded handset,
lif ted it
A faraway voice said:ﬁ West Cor nwall is calling
M ister Norman R ettjer. Is he there?ﬂ
D on said: ﬁOne minute. He™s just come in.ﬂ
He held out the instrument as R ettjer hurr ied
across the room.
ﬁHello? – Yes, this is Rettjer speak ing ... Oh yes,
M ister Grolheim, I can hear you plainly – . Yes, I
have the exac t amount in the denominations you
speci˚ed – . Yes, yes, I understand ... to the studio
– and turn it over to Š? Hm – .Ver y well – . The
189
instruc tions shall be followed to the letter – .Yes, I
will wait here for your later call.ﬂ He hung up, a puz
-
zled scowl creasing his forehead.
D on said: ﬁ You timed that nicely.ﬂ
ﬁI was delayed,ﬂ R ettjer said shortly.ﬁThat was
your man Grolheim. I must say that if he is acting as
an unwilling go-bet ween, he manages to conceal his
reluc tance remar k ably well.ﬂ
ﬁ The money is to be taken to the television
studio?ﬂ
ﬁI can™t fathom it.ﬂ R ettjer shook his head, ba˙ed.
ﬁI t ™s to be delivered to M iss I nez.ﬂ
190
## CHAPTER 29

**PAINTING THE TOWN**

DON SAID:ﬁSHE™S ATTHE STUDIO NOW?ﬂ
ﬁR ehearsal, yes. Show ™s all balled up. She wasn™t
there this morning or this after noon. Hell of a mess.ﬂ
R ettjer gazed speculatively at the maid, who was
waiting by the door to the dining room. ﬁFrances,
br ing me some co˜ee - cognac, will you please?ﬂ
She left.
The ˚nancier paced the ˛oor.ﬁ This is a contin
-
genc y for which I™ll have to admit I am completely
unprepared.To have this bunch of bandits ask for
the ransom to be delivered to M iss I nez.ﬂ
ﬁI t ™s all of a piece,ﬂ D on said.ﬁCut from the same
cloth as the phone call from Grolheim. Scheme is to
make it seem as if Lily Inez is in on the steal, in on
the deal.You can™t believe she™s mixed up in it.Well, I
refuse to concede that any Ambletts man is.ﬂ
ﬁ You may be right, Cadee. I™ll go along with that.
But I have an uncomfor table feeling that someone is
mak ing a fool of me. I t™s a sensation I don™t enjoy.ﬂ
ﬁNow you know how I felt when you told me, in
191
your oˆce, that M issus Rettjer wasn™t suˆciently
interested in you to raise a fuss. I™ve just come from
your Greenwich place, where I learned she™s by no
means as disinterested as you led me to believe.ﬂ
ﬁAh.ﬂ R ettjer stopped pacing.ﬁ Trouble?ﬂ
ﬁCour t trouble, per haps,ﬂ D on said. ﬁNot the k ind
my fr iends face from the crew that hijacked the
sables.Where™s the ˚f ty thousand?ﬂ
ﬁBr ief case is on the table in the foyer there,ﬂ
R ettjer pointed.ﬁ You™re to hand it to her, ask no
questions.ﬂ
ﬁI t won™t be that simple.ﬂ D on went to the foyer,
was sur prised at how heavy the cowhide brief case
w a s.
ﬁNow I™m sorr y I agreed to let you make the con
-
tac t. I™d like to hand over the money myself. Just to
see – ﬂ
ﬁ Too late to change your mind. I™m on my way.ﬂ
D on went out and down.
He had been as much astonished at Grolheim™s
instruc tions as Rettjer. It wasn™t possible that the
star was interested in the ransom. Her weekly
income from records, endorsements, movies, guest
appearances,
Painting the Town
itself... would easily
top the ˚ft y thousand which hefted so heavily in the
br ief case.ﬁHand it to her, ask no questions.ﬂWhat
could it mean other than that the k idnappers had
already been in touch with her, told her what to do
with the money.The only possible conclusion was
that she must know at least one of the kidnappers.
That, accordingly, she could be trusted to deliver
the funds without betraying them. In which case,
cer tainly she must have suspected the identit y of
192
the cr iminals right from the time of the hijacking
last night.Yet she™d kept her suspicions to herself, in
spite of the lethal danger to Press, to Grolheim. No
doubt this was what had passed through Rettjer ™s
mind too.
D on drove toTelecastTowers, tur ned the car over
to an attendant in the underground par king lot,
lugged the brief case up to the eighth ˛oor.
Str ic tly up to you now, boy. You asked for this job.
A lot depends on keeping your eye on the ball. A lot?
Lives!
The studio blazed with lights, buzzed with activ
-
it y. Ac tors in costume and make-up crowded behind
and beside the sets.The orchestra leader in full dress
˛icked his baton at pink-unifor med musicians; a
wave of melody surged through the great hall.
Lily Inez sang a Showboat tune with the proper
air of melancholy. Dressed as a dance -hall gir l of the
G ay N ineties, she leaned against an old-time bar, the
sultr y voice low and clear over the muted brass.
D on spoke softly to a dancer in harlequin:
ﬁ Where™ll I ˚nd Elton Hadley?ﬂ
The dancer pointed to a huge glass panel in the
studio wall.ﬁControl room.ﬂ
I f the star saw him, Don couldn™t tell. Though he
passed within twent y feet of her, her voice never
faltered. But the manager had seen him. By the time
D on reached the door mar ked: do not open this door
when red light is on, there was a sudden movement
behind that glass panel.
He opened the door. Hadley was coming out of
the control room.
ﬁI mportant pack age for M iss I nez.ﬂ D on held up
193
the brief case.ﬁHave to give it to her right away.ﬂ
ﬁShe™ll be through the number in a minute. But I
don™t like Šﬂ
ﬁ This is urgent. G et me to her.ﬂ
Hadley said: ﬁ What is it?ﬂ
ﬁS omething from R ettjer. She™ll k now what it is.ﬂ
ﬁOk ay.We can slip around to the dressing-room
entrance– .ﬂ
D on followed him. ﬁCan anyone barge in here, get
to see the members of the cast?ﬂ
ﬁNot supposed to. But in rehearsal nobody both
-
ers much.ﬂ
ﬁ You better bother.To watch out for R ettjer™s
daughter.ﬂ
ﬁM y God! Joyna loose again?ﬂ
ﬁ With a gun.ﬂ
ﬁJesus!Where is she?ﬂ
ﬁShe said she was coming here, tonight.ﬂ
ﬁ That ™s all we need,ﬂ the manager groaned.ﬁ That
whack y brat, blood in her eye.ﬂ
ﬁI didn™t see her in the studio. But I could have
missed her, all those people.ﬂ
ﬁ We™ll have to war n the ushers.ﬂ Hadley mopped
perspiration o˜ his high forehead.ﬁ There. Lil™s ˚n
-
ished now. Come on.ﬂ
A tide of dancers, in turkey- gobbler costume,
swept past them. Two propert y men maneuvered a
pumpk in chariot in their path. Lily Inez saw Hadley,
clapped a hand to her ears in dumb show as she
came toward him.
ﬁI murdered that one,ﬂ she cried, then recognized
D on, ﬁOh – you.ﬂ
He nodded. ﬁ With a special packet for you.ﬂ He
194
held oat the brief case.
She took it, near ly dropped it.ﬁ Why, it™s heav y.ﬂ
Hadley reached out to take the burden.
ﬁNo.ﬂ She clung to the leather handle. ﬁI™ll keep
i t .ﬂ
D on said: ﬁ You k now what it is?ﬂ
ﬁ Yes.ﬂ She didn™t look at him. ﬁExcuse me – ﬁShe
walked rapidly away, calling – ﬁI™ll be back for the
apple-bobbing number, Elton.ﬂ
D on followed her as quickly as he could, dodging
around scenery, cameras, ac tors.
She hur r ied down a cor r idor, tur ned a cor ner,
disappeared.
He was only a few yards behind her. But when
he reached the cor ner, she was vanishing through a
door.
I t was labeled:
WOMEN
.
Well, hell, you can™t trail her in there. But you can
wait until she comes out with the brief case. Or until
some other female does.What an idea for a ransom
drop! A man-proof meeting place.
He waited, thinking of the brunette in the
turquoise gown. Only in all probability M issus Chad
-
bour ne wouldn™t be wear ing the same gown two
nights in succession.
Gir ls came out, gir ls went in. Some of them eyed
him cur iously, but he didn™t dare move around the
comer for fear of missing the all-important contac t.
But he ˛attened himself against the wall, tr ying to
make himself look as inconspicuous as possible. I n
that position he could see both up and down the hall
leading to the lavator y.
He had only been there a minute when, out of
195
the comer of his eye, he saw a raspber ry- colored
raincoat.
He tur ned his back swiftly, hoping she hadn™t seen
him, but half expec ting a bullet in die back.
As she came past him, he grabbed her.
She screeched, spun around, clawing at his face.
The raincoat ripped. She tore away, ran wildly
back up the hall, the pistol swinging in her right
hand. She gained the corner, rounded it.
He spr inted af ter her.
196
## CHAPTER 30

**A LATEˇMODEL PONTIAC**

**MEMBERS OF THE PAINTING THE TOWN CAST CAME**

swar ming out of a studio exit, sur rounding Joyna,
block ing her way, pinning her against the wall. She
squealed, brandished the pistol.
They laughed at her, considering it horseplay,
supposing the gun to be a prop pistol.They k idded
her. One of the harlequins made a playful pass at
her.
D on closed in. She tried to get room to raise the
automatic.
He seized her arm, t wisting it until she screeched,
dropped the weapon. He bent to pick it up. She
stamped on his hand but he got the gun, put more
pressure on her wrist until she whimpered.
ﬁLet me go,ﬂ she moaned. ﬁ You™re break ing my
ar m.ﬂ
ﬁI™m saving your life, you little lunatic.ﬂ He turned
her around, brought her wrist behind her back.
Hadley ™s imposing head loomed above the crowd.
ﬁG ot her?ﬂ
197
ﬁFor the moment,ﬂ he said morosely.ﬁG ot the
popgun, which is more important. Here ... M iss
R ettjer ™s all yours.ﬂ
Hadley was pale, sweating, shaken. ﬁ What the hell
can I do with her?ﬂ
Joyna spat at him.ﬁ You™ll let me go, that ™s what
you™ll do. Or I™ll get my father to throw you out of this
studio.ﬂ She fought to get free.
ﬁShut up, brat.ﬂ D on motioned to the manager.
ﬁGrab her other hand before she claws your eyes
out. I f I were you I™d get a couple of your adver tising
agenc y men to help you cart her back to M iss I nez™
apar tment. Her father ™s there.Tur n her over to him.ﬂ
Joyna k icked Don in the shin. ﬁ What do you think
my father can do with me, you bastard! I™ll burn
down the goddamn apartment house.ﬂ
D on thumbed on the safet y, held out the pistol to
Hadley.ﬁYou better take this. Just to show how far
o˜ her rocker she is.ﬂ
Hadley took the gun reluctantly.ﬁDid she really
tr y to shoot Lil?ﬂ
ﬁShe was on her way. I cut her o˜.ﬂ D on released
Joyna™s wr ist. ﬁ You™re on your own with her, Hadley.
I have to get hold of your star.ﬂ He moved away as
Joyna ˛ailed at him ine˜ectually, snar ling and kick
-
ing at Hadley simultaneously.
Hadley called: ﬁ Tell Lil – ﬁThe rest was drowned
in Joyna™s shrieks of rage.
D on hurr ied back to his post by
WOMEN
.
A ˚le of females crowded in past him, others
came out in groups of two and three. No dance -hall
costume among them./But – was one of them the
k idnaper™s contac t girl?
198
He spoke to a couple of emerging dancers in
cancan sk irts and petticoats.ﬁIs M iss Inez in there?ﬂ
They looked blank.ﬁOh no – she has her own pr i
-
vate dressing room and lavator y. She™s not in there,
I™m sure.ﬂ
You mu˜ed it. Because of that juvenile hellcat.You
gambled on mak ing the contac t so you could make a
deal for Jim Preston, M y Grolheim.You lost, lost time
the cops might have used to round up the kidnappers
if you hadn™t tr ied to lone-wolf it. Now what do you
do?
He remained on watch a moment longer, hoping
for a glimpse of Missus Chadbourne.Then he went
back to the studio.The rehearsal had stopped.The
musicians wereﬁ tak ing ten.ﬂ Neither Hadley nor his
charge were around. Lily Inez was not there.
You™re not supposed to ask her any questions, but
the hell with that, now.You™ll put it up to her straight,
tell who you gave that brief case to ... or talk to the
police.
But he couldn™t ˚nd her. Nobody had seen her
since the ˚nish of the
Showboat
number. Nor was
anyone sure when the rehearsal would be resumed.
He went down to the garage, tur ned in his car
check .There was one slim hope left ... in half an hour
the hijackers were supposed to notify Rettjer where
the sables would be returned.That was the last
chance of making contac t with them.
He realized that now they had the cash, the
danger to M y and Press was much greater. If the
k idnappers™ intention was to frame Grolheim for
an inside job, the groundwor k had been well done.
What grand jury would fail to indic t after hear ing
199
M or r ie Ber kowsk y ™s testimony about the phone call
from Grolheim, Norman R ettjer™s stor y about the
talks he™d had with the fur buyer?
I f Grolheim could be accused of connivance, why
not Press? Why not Ambletts™ Chief of Protec tion,
too?
I t ™s all of a piece, cut from the same cloth. That ™s
what you told R ettjer. Now if they follow that patter n,
where will they have the crown sable coat retur ned?
Why, somewhere that would add to the suspicion of
an inside job.
Not My ™s house; there would be police on guard;
the k idnappers would know that. Not Rettjer ™s, that
wouldn™t have any Ambletts connotation. Neither
would the Buckinghurst.There were police on watch
at the Herford, too ... so even if that might be the
contac t spot, it wouldn™t help to go there. B esides,
they tried that overcoatﬁplant ﬂ; they wouldn™t
retur n the sables there too.
Jim Preston™s!That might accomplish the tie-up
they were af ter. He considered it carefully.That
would be according to patter n, all r ight.
H is car came. He cut across town, drove down to
the Brooklyn Br idge, headed for Flatbush.
M aybe he was wrong, coming all the hellangone
out here, solely on the basis of his reasoned conclu
-
sion as to what the k idnappers might do with the
crown sable coat.There was one last ditch alterna
-
tive ŠMy Grolheim had phoned fromWest Cornwall,
Connec ticut.
I t was probable that Broken Nose had been there
with him, that immediately after the call Grolheim
would have been led back to some hide -out near by.
200
But what were the chances of locating that hide - out,
with no more to go on than the description of the
t wo men? It might take weeks to search the sur
-
rounding countr y. All that was left were minutes.
I t was ˚ve past seven by the dashboard clock
when he ran the spor ts car into the driveway of the
t wo -family house where the Prestons lived.
There were lights on the far side of the house,
where Jim lived; the nearer half was dark .
He rang the doorbell over the

plate.
Sibyl opened the door. ﬁD on! I thought you™d be
– pr isoner by now.ﬂ
ﬁS cheme back˚red. How ™s Ruth?ﬂ
ﬁLow in the mind. She asked me to come and stay
with her, af ter the store closed. I told her what you
were planning to do. She™s lying down.ﬂ
He told her about the call fromWest Cor nwall,
the tr ip to the studio, the transfer of the brief case
to Lily Inez, about Joyna and Hadley and the missed
contac tﬁOnly other thing is to grab the part y who™s
to tur n over the coat, if that ™s possible.ﬂ He went
to the phone, rang the number on Lily Inez* gilded
handset.
Ruth Preston came into the living room as he
dialed. She put her arms around him and wept. D on
was as big brother ly as possible, until R ettjer came
on the line.
The ˚nancier was br ief and bellicose. ﬁCan™t talk
long. My daughter ™s here. S o are Hadley and Miss
I nez.This place is a madhouse.ﬂ
ﬁ What about Grolheim? Did he call you again?ﬂ
ﬁNo. Lady did. S aid the item in question would
201
be delivered at the home of a Mister Preston, 241 La
Ver ne Place, Flatbush.That ™s your friend, isn™t it? The
one who couldn™t have had anything to do with this
business?ﬂ
ﬁ That ™s right.You want to make a bet, I™ll give you
any odds you like this wasn™t any of his doing.ﬂ
ﬁI™m just telling you –ﬁ
ﬁ Thanks. I™m at Preston™s now.ﬂ D on hung up.
You hit it sock on the nose for once. Now – if it
isn™t too late –
He got away from Ruth.ﬁI™m going outside.The
coat is supposed to be delivered here. Maybe it has
been, already. But if notŠﬂ He went to the front
door.
Coming slowly along the street was a green and
brown station wagon. A late -model Pontiac.

## CHAPTER 31

**A BLINDING FLASH**

ﬁ THAT ™S GR OLHEIM™S STATIONWAGON.ﬂ HE DRE W
back from the curtained glass of the front door.ﬁGir l
dr iving. She™s going on past the house. Probably
circling the block as a precaution to make sure
there™s no police trap.ﬂ
Sibyl said: ﬁ Was it M issus Chadbourne?ﬂﬁCouldn™t
see.ﬂ He opened the door.ﬁBut she might have seen
me. Can™t tell. I™m duck ing across the street. If she
hasn™t been frightened away, she may come back
with the sables.ﬂ
Ruth caught his ar m.ﬁM aybe Jim™s in that car!ﬂ
ﬁDidn™t see a man, Ruth.ﬂ D on patted her hand,
disengaged himself.ﬁBut if he isn™t, I may be able
to make the gir l dr ive me to where they™re holding
Press.ﬂ He ran.
Sibyl cr ied: ﬁI™m going to follow you. I n my car.ﬂ He
called: ﬁNo, no!You might upset the applecart. Close
that door.ﬂ He gained the shelter of shrubbery beside
the house across the street. The door of the Preston
home closed.
203
D own the block, headlights swung into view,
moved toward him. The Pontiac slowed, stopped.
The car lights went o˜.The motor kept purr ing.
The Chadbourne woman got out. She wore the
mink but over her ar m she carr ied the Lily Inez.
There was no mistaking those crown sables even
under the faint light of the street lamp a hundred
feet away.
She crossed the street, hesitated at the Preston
porch, turned away, hur r ied around the side of the
house.
D on crept to the side of the station wagon,
waited, crouching.
M issus Chadbourne hurr ied to the sports car,
tossed the sables in the front seat, ran back to the
Pontiac, jerked open the front door, jumped in.
D on had the door on his side open before she
could put on the lights. He slid in beside her.
She gasped.
He held his old .45 so the faint light glinted on the
bar rel. ﬁS or r y to have missed you at my hotel, M issus
Chadbourne.You™re getting to be quite a coatroom
g i r l .ﬂ
Her voice trembled.ﬁI put the sables ... in the little
car ... across the street ... as was agreed.What more
do you want?ﬂ
ﬁ There was another point in the agreement.
Where are the men you abducted?ﬂ
ﬁ They ™ll be back later.ﬂ
ﬁS or r y not to take your word for that. Have to
make sure of it. G et this wagon rolling. O ught to
make it out West Cor nwall way in an hour and a
half.ﬂ
204
She switched on the lights, pulled away from the
cur b.
He looked behind him in the second seats, on
the ˛oor. ﬁ What ™d you do with the boodle? The br ief
case?ﬂ
She ignored the question. ﬁI f you make me drive
you to Mister Grolheim you™ll get me killed; maybe
you don™t realize that.ﬂ
ﬁI haven™t forgotten you saved my life this mor n
-
ing. I™ll try to return the compliment. You don™t think
M y Grolheim would hurt you?ﬂ
ﬁHe k illed Max. I n self-defense, but stillŠﬂ
ﬁDid you see this yourself?ﬂ
ﬁNo. But Ar ny told me. And Mister Grolheim didn™t
contradic t him. So you seeŠﬂ
Ar ny? Ar nold Broken Nose?
ﬁDidn™t Arny get sore at
having his side-k ick beaten to death?ﬂ
ﬁO f course not. M ax was a menace to all of us.We
didn™t k now he used H – . When he had a load on,
he was a ˚end. Mister Grolheim never suspec ted M ax
would be coked up last night, that ™s what star ted
all the trouble. M ax went berser k , beat your friend
Preston over the head. Ar ny and Mister Grolheim had
agreed there wasn™t to be any violence Šﬂ
ﬁ Tr ying to blame it on Grolheim?To make it look
as if he was in on it with you?ﬂ
ﬁ Why, he was. It was his idea to begin with. But
when Max ˛ew o˜ the handle and began to ac t like a
raving maniac,M ister Grolheim wanted to back out.
The or iginal plan was to have me ˛y the coat out to
Buenos Aires and sell it there. But af ter M ister Pres
-
ton was hurt so badlyŠﬂ
ﬁIs he still alive?ﬂ
205
ﬁI don™t k now.ﬂ She drove in silence for a bit. ﬁI –
don™t think so,ﬂ she added in a low voice.
S o much for all their lying promises! For your keep
-
ing Ruth™s hopes alive. Old Press is dead – and they
mean to make it look as if Grolheim is guilty along
with Max and Broken Nose.You may not be able to
bring Press back home but you can still clear M y, bring
the others to book .
She switched on the defroster ; the snow had
tur ned to freezing rain once more.ﬁ When Mister
Grolheim found out that M ax had nearly killed you,
there at his house, it nearly drove him out of his
mind – Mister Grolheim, I mean.ﬂ
ﬁI can believe that.ﬂ
M y ™s been prac tically out of his
mind for the past t went y-four hours, but not because
he™s been on a diet of heroin.
ﬁEven if I don™t buy that
business about his beating M ax ™s brains outWho
took the body back to Grolheim™s – and why?ﬂ
ﬁI took it back.ﬂ
ﬁ You hauled that dead weight into the kitchen by
yourself?ﬂ
ﬁ Yes.You don™t think I™m strong enough?ﬂ
I think you lie.You had help, must have had. From
the guy who came back from LasVegas with you.
ﬁI™ll
tell you what I think , Missus Chadbourne. I believe
you when you say no violence was intended; I sup
-
pose Ar ny ™s plans had to be switched on the spur
of the moment af ter Max ran amuck . But I don™t go
for that business about My Grolheim™s having been
in on the scheme from the beginning. You wouldn™t
have taken the body back to his house unless you™d
wanted to make it look as if he was mixed up in it –
when actually he was the innocent bystander.ﬂ
206
ﬁAren™t you overlook ing all those telephone calls?
Would he have made those unlessŠﬂ
ﬁI think he might have. Under cer tain circum
-
stances.ﬂ He watched a pair of low-to -the -ground
headlights trailing along behind. Had Sibyl stuck her
neck out and followed in the sports car?
No ... at the last light before the bridge to Manhat
-
tan, the lights drew nearer, pulled ahead. I t was a red
Jaguar, driven by a youth in motorc ycle goggles and
a black leather jacket.
He went on. ﬁContradic t me if I™m wrong – but
I™d say the whole setup got out of hand after M ax
slugged Jim Preston at the Buckinghurst. Ar ny had
to improvise to protec t himself and cover up for you.
The k idnapping was an after thought. And the cir
-
cumstances I just spoke of, somebody thought those
up r ight o˜ the top of his head.ﬂ
She drove across Chambers, saying nothing.
He t wisted around to look behind at the Broad
-
way stop light. No sign of a spor ts car. He felt
relieved. ﬁ Then when Max clobbered me and you
told your pal about that, he lost his head. He may
have acted in self-defense, as you said Grolheim did.
But whether it was manslaughter or murder, your
chum k illed Max. And he helped you carr y the body
to M y™s k itchen because, by then, you were all sure
your only chance of avoiding prosecution was to lay
the blame on My ™s shoulders.ﬂ
The station wagon climbed the ramp, joined
the tr ickle of traˆc moving northward on the
expressway.
M issus Chadbourne said suddenly: ﬁ You k now so
goddamn much about it, what ™s the use of my tr ying
207
to tell you the truth?ﬂ
ﬁM ight be a novel experience. M ight tr y it – just
for k icks. And maybe to save your own sk in.ﬂ
ﬁG o to hell.ﬂ She sulked, refusing to say another
syllable.
The stor m grew worse. R ain lashed against the
windshield.The highway became a sheet of glare
ice.Whitecaps showed against the dark mir ror of the
Hudson. At the park way toll gates by Spuyten D uyvil
the policeman stepped out of his booth, came close
to the car on her side.
Is he checking on that alarm Dimmock must have
sent out? Man with prematurely white hair, a white
mustache, a banged-up face?
But the cop said only:ﬁ Take it easy, folks. R oad ™s
slippery as greased glass.ﬂ
D on leaned across her to pay the toll. ﬁ We™ll watch
it, oˆcer.ﬂ
Later she said: ﬁI could have tur ned you in then.ﬂ
ﬁNot without turning yourself in, too.ﬂ
The clock on the dash said eight, eight-˚fteen,
eight-thirt y.There was no more conversation. Don
was glad of the stinging rain, the bitter cold; it kept
him awake – and the sucking of the tires on the wet
ice was making him unutterably sleepy.
For just a moment, af ter they had crossed the
Connec ticut line, he dozed o˜.
Awoke to the sickening sensation of a sk id.
The station wagon was slipping sidewise down a
long hill with a curve at the bottom, a white culver t.
He had a split-second picture of Missus Chad
-
bour ne, with clenched teeth and contorted face,
˚ghting the wheel.
208
Then a spinning, a shock which slammed him
head˚rst into the windshield, pain dissolving in a
blinding ˛ash of light.
209
## CHAPTER 32

**TOO MANY INTHE KNOW**

**THE SOFT GLOW FROM A PINK LAMPSHADE SPILLED**

claret over a white candlewick spread. I t took D on a
while, after opening his eyes, to realize that the winy
light made the ˚ngers of his lef t hand appear bloody.
He wr iggled his ˚ngers. They were caked with
blood.
I t came back to him slowly. The lurching sk id. The
sickening spin. Throwing his hand up to protec t his
eyes. The crash.
He felt as if he ought to be in a hospital. But this
was no private ward.Venetian blinds, television set,
a door with a white R egulations card tacked to it, a
wheat- colored writing table. On the table was a cow
-
hide brief case. R ettjer™s br ief case.
ﬁD on™t tell me,ﬂ growled an unpleasant voice,
ﬁ you didn™t frac ture y ™ freakin™ sk ull!We were just
getting ready to report you as an accident fatalit y.ﬂ
Tur ning his neck brought a shar p pain, but Don
t wisted around enough to see a bony ˚st with a
sapphire r ing as large as brass k nuckles. His eyes
210
traveled up to the stub of cigar drooping from a
smir k ing mouth, the broken nose, the bulgy brown
eyes. Ar ny.
ﬁB een better if you™d cracked up permanently,
Cadee. Saved ever ybody a mess of trouble.ﬂThe
man on the other bed ˛ourished a gun for emphasis.
D on™s .45.
ﬁPleasure to disappoint you,ﬂ D on muttered.
ﬁI t won™t be any pleasure,ﬂ Ar ny answered.ﬁ We™ll
just have to ˚nish what that bang against the wind
-
shield started. No other way now.ﬂ
ﬁSure.ﬂ Don shif ted painfully to raise on one
elbow.ﬁI can tell you a better way.ﬂ
ﬁNo.We had it all set.ﬂThe re˛ec tion from the
claret light glinted on the gun, on that star sapphire.
ﬁ The big boy ™s paid o˜; he can a˜ord it. Lily the Dilly
gets her coat back , all she wants. Max got what he
deser ved, who can k ick? Nobody else gets smeared,
nobody gets hurt.ﬂ
ﬁNobody but me,ﬂ Don said dour ly.ﬁNobody but
Jim Preston. And his wife. And My Grolheim.ﬂ
ﬁNot our fault your buddy got slugged. Sor r y
about his wife, but she™s responsible for the ˚x
you™re in. She promised you™d keep hands o˜. You
had to stick your chin out. So –ﬁ
D on managed to prop himself up against the
headboard.ﬁI stuck it out to give you a break .To
show you a way out.ﬂ
ﬁ There isn™t any. I™m a t wo -time loser already.
They framed me for jumping a whisky truck . So any
rap from here in is the big rap for me. Before I let any
judge belt me with the book, I™ll belt anybody who
can swear me in for life.That ™s you.ﬂ
211
ﬁAnd Grolheim?ﬂ
ﬁNah. If there™s any question of ex tortion, he did
all the dirt y wor k .ﬂ
ﬁUnder a gun. Or underŠﬂ
ﬁHorse. He™s lost most of his marbles. He wanted
to keep the crummy sables himself, just to look at.ﬂ
The door opened. M issus Chadbourne came in.
She wore a suede suit, powder gray, smar tly tailored;
she seemed pleased to see Don sitting up.ﬁ Your
head must be made of rock, mister.ﬂ
Ar ny said:ﬁI™d rather break that k ind of rock once,
quick , than spend the rest of my life on a rock pile
with a sledge.We can™t set this store dick loose like
Grolheim.ﬂ
D on rubbed the back of his hand on the candle
-
wick .ﬁIt won™t settle anything to ˚x my wagon. Too
many are in on the know. Rettjer k nows the money
went to somebody Miss Inez k new well enough not
to give away. S everal people knew Missus Chad
-
bour ne was in LasVegas at the same time Miss I nez
was.The police k now M ax had been a truck-jumper,
that most likely he™d have been wor k ing with some
-
one he met in that line.The old bird on the service
elevator at the Buck inghurst has given a good
descr iption of you, Ar ny. My oˆce k nows I came out
to Connecticut tonight. If you k nock me in the head,
it ™ll only be one more step toward that chair you
never get up out of, on your own.ﬂ
ﬁHe™s so right, Ar ny,ﬂ she said earnestly.
ﬁHe™s a slick talker, Gretchen.ﬂ Ar ny smiled, but
there was nothing agreeable about it. ﬁ We can™t fall
for that gu˜. Once he got in cour t he™d change his
tune. He wants to get even for his buddy.ﬂ
212
D on kept anger out of his voice.ﬁI can™t do any
-
thing for Jim Preston now. But I™ll make a bargain
with you. Let M y Grolheim go.You say you™re not
afraid he might testify against you. Give him the keys
to his station wagon, turn him loose.ﬂ
Ar ny asked: ﬁ What ™s your side of the bargain?ﬂ
ﬁI™ll show you how you can get out of a jam with
no more than a slap on the wrist. I f you don™t think
it will wor k , you can do what you want with me ... so
you™re not taking any chance.ﬂ
Gretchen Chadbourne cr ied: ﬁAr ny!Take him up
on it!What can we lose?ﬂ
Ar ny said:ﬁLet ™s have this allagazamŠwe™re -in-
the - clear dope ˚rst.ﬂ
ﬁNo,ﬂ Don said.ﬁLet My go, ˚rst. And let me talk to
him.To make sure he™s all right.ﬂ
ﬁHe™s not.ﬂ Ar ny hef ted the gun by the barrel
as if weighing its usefulness as a club.ﬁI told you.
He™s gaga. I™ll show you. Bring the whack in here,
Gretchen.ﬂ
She hur r ied out.
Ar ny said:ﬁYou can give out now, Cadee. She
don™t have to k now.ﬂ
ﬁFor my deal she does. She saved my life once. I
told her I™d tr y to return the compliment. I mean to,
if I can. If you bop me with that gun, you™ll both be
dead ducks. I don™t happen to think she™s guilty of
much beyond agreeing to do a favor for a friend.ﬂ
She retur ned, pushing Grolheim before her.
The fur buyer ™s eyes were bright but his skin was
sallow, his facial muscles were relaxed as if he™d just
wakened. He walked slowly, stepping carefully as
if his feet were sink ing into deep muck.ﬁ Well, of all
213
people,ﬂ he said cheerfully.ﬁI certainly am glad to
see you, Don.ﬂ
He didn™t mention the blood on your face, your
hand. Maybe he thinks it all came from that beating
M ax gave you.
ﬁ They treat you ok ay, My?ﬂ
ﬁNo complaints.ﬂ Grolheim sat down on the other
end of the bed from Ar ny.ﬁI™m a little tired of ham
-
burg sandwiches, though.ﬂ He closed his eyes as if
exhausted.
Ar ny said:ﬁWe got the dough. It ™s over there on
the desk. I™ll give you your share in a minute.ﬂ
ﬁNo hur ry.ﬂ Grolheim ˛apped a hand up negli
-
gently. ﬁNo rush. I™m not wor r ied about the money.
Ever ything™s all r ight, now Don™s here.ﬂ
M issus Chadbourne beamed: ﬁ You see, M ister
Cadee?ﬂ
D on said: ﬁEver ything™s not all r ight with Jim Pres
-
ton, is it, M y?ﬂ
The fur buyer roused himself as if from a day
-
dream. He shook his head like a dog coming out of
the water.ﬁNo,ﬂ he said more loudly.ﬁO f course it
isn™t, Don.ﬂ H is shoulders straightened. ﬁ They k illed
Preston, you know that?They murdered him in cold
blood.They™ll have to pay for that, won™t they, D on?ﬂ
Ar ny spoke savagely.ﬁ You™ll pay, you weasly son
of a bitch.Take him back, Gretchen.They™ll both pay
now.This one goes ˚rst!ﬂ
She cr ied: ﬁNo, no more, Arny! D on™t!You™ll –
you™ll have to k ill me, too, if you do it. I won™t stand
for itŠI won™tŠI won™tŠﬂ
Strong light ˚ltered in through theVenetians.
ﬁShut up,ﬂ Ar ny whispered. ﬁCar outside. Stopping
here.ﬂ He crept to the window, lif ted a slat, peered
214
out.
D on slid his feet over the side of the bed.
Sib, he thought She followed us somehow!
