## CHAPTER I: YOUR LAST CHANCE …

The attendant at the tollgate punched his register, held out a handful of change. “Little colder tonight.”

“Yeah.” The driver slid the station wagon away.

The man in the middle seat blinked at stinging sweat trickling off his eyebrows. He resisted the impulse to reach for his handkerchief; the watchful teenager at his right might misinterpret the movement.

*That was your last chance*, the man told himself bitterly. *You’ll never have another. Never in this life.*

All he’d have had to do was cry out. *Help!* Or *Kidnap!* That would have done it. The driver might have made a fast getaway, but the attendant would have notified the state troopers; the chase would have been on.

Yet he’d lacked the nerve—just as he’d not been able to summon up the courage to fling open the door and dive out onto the highway at that stop light a few miles back. That couple in the other car across the street would surely have seen him, would have come to his aid.

But fear of his captors had paralyzed him absolutely; he was the helpless rabbit staring, fascinated, at the beady eyes of the snake. Knowing what the end would be, yet powerless to prevent it.

It was not because they had actually threatened him. What had dropped back there in Buckinghurst—that had been more effective than any spoken threat. What had half hypnotized him had been their matter-of-fact brutality and ruthlessness.

There was also the numbing recognition of the inference to be drawn from the fact that his abductors had made not the slightest effort to keep him from seeing where they were taking him. Evidently they were not worrying about what he might say, later.

The headlights funneled down a dark, grove-guarded slope, flashed past a white barn and a farmhouse, touched the pale cement of a creek bridge, bored on through the pine-shadowed gloom of the next rise.

He knew these Berkshire foothills well; this was the way he’d driven to the Tanglewood festival only a few months ago. But he could think of no reason for them to be bringing him up into these lonely hills in November.

“If you’re going to kill me—” he began, shocked at the harsh queerness of his voice.

The driver laughed tolerantly. “Don’t be silly. Kill you? We need you in our business.”

The youth beside him, the teenager with the eyes that looked like peeled grapes, added: “You want to look at it this way, doc. We’re taking you into partnership. You could make a sensational score outa this.”

The man felt the muscles of his throat constrict. Partners with this cold-blooded pair? He knew what that meant: it was only a question of time before the partnership would be abruptly ended with bludgeon or bullet. Yet until that time came there was margin for hope, even though slim. He would hold onto that hope as long as he could; he would string it out as long as possible.

“As businessmen”—he tried to keep the terror out of his voice—“you know you can’t ever sell it.”

The driver chuckled softly. “Try to get your mind out of the conservative channel, pard. We’re thinking of a radical approach.”

“But how can you sell it?” the man asked. “It’s the only one of its kind in the world. There’ll probably never be another like it. It’s not like a diamond necklace; you can’t sell the skins separately. You can’t dispose of it the way you might an old master; it’s only valuable when the public sees it.”

“We heard,” the youth with the green-grape eyes said affably, “it’s worth a king’s ransom.”

“It is,” the man said bleakly. “There’s no way to put price on it; it’s priceless—because it can’t be duplicated, now. Possibly never. But—”

“That’s all we want out of it,” the driver said over his shoulder. “That’s what you’re going to get us.”

The teenager sniggered. “Just a good, average king’s ransom … and if you play ball nice, we’ll cut you in for a big, fat slice.”

The station wagon slowed at the crest of a hill. The headlights swerved to touch a low building flanked by two rows of blue cottages, holding in bright illumination:

**MOUNTAIN VIEW—LODGE & COTTAGES**  
*Country Fare … City Conveniences*
